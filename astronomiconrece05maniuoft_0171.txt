LIBRO I ADDENDA 109

prefixed to M's three apographs have therefore no authority behind
them, but they are these: M. Manilii astronomicon liber primus
incipit Η, M. Manilii astronomicon liber primus foeliciter incipit U,
Marci Manilii Boeui astronomici liber primus incipit R.

The gentile name emerging from Manili Manlii Milnili is
certainly Manilius. The much more famous name of Manlius would
not thus have been corrupted, whereas the name of Manilius is
actually altered into Manlius in this same codex M at Stat. silu. 1
praef. l. 30 ed. Klotz.

The third appellation‚ in the script which M uses for its titles,
may, as Ι have said, be either Boeiii or Boeiu ; but in this particular
title the u of tertius is very differently formed. It can hardly be
Romi, as R interprets it (U and H, being puzzled, omit it altogether).
It certainly is not Boeni, as V and Ellis represent ; for the letter n
occurs four times in this title and is always capital in shape. And,
no less certainly, it is not Boetii, as van Wageningen asserts in
Mnem. 1914 p. 111 and as Mr Thielscher repeats in Philol. LXXXII
p. 177; for the letter t occurs here six times and always has an
unmistakable cross-stroke. When van Wageningen affirms that M
gives eclipticis with the ti similarly written in the title at 1v 817, that
too is false ε it gives cylipiicis (Loewe wrongly reported εῖν), unless
the two strokes after p are rather u, as they seemed to Ellis. The
corrupt cylipiicis is of course ultimately derived from cclipticis, and
the corrupt Boeiii may no doubt be similarly derived from Boetii.
This cognomen, Boethius, does not make its appearance before the
5¹⁵¹1 century; but Boethus is at least as old as the 2¹¹d‚ and may
possibly have belonged to our author, as Vollmer Berl. Phil. Wooh.
1904 p. 107 n. suggested. On the other hand the word may be a
mere interpolation. It occurs only in one of the three places where
the poet is given a name, and it occurs in that one place where his
name appears as Manlius3 so that it may have been added by a
scribe who remembered that this was one of the names of the
celebrated Boethius. But Mr Thielscher Philol. LXXXII pp. 177 sq.
prefers to suppose that the poet's true name had utterly disappeared
from the Mss of his poem, and that in the middle ages there was
affixed to it by pure conjecture the name of that then famous man.
Manlius, as I have already said, would not have been corrupted to
Manilius and Milnilius, least of all if Boethius followed it; and I
must now add, what is sufficiently obvious and ought to have kept
Mr Thielscher silent, that his supposition does not account for the
praenomen Marcus, present in all three places.
