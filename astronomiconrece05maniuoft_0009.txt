The first volume of the edition of Manilius now completed was
published in 1903, the second in 1912, the third in 1916, and the
fourth in 1920. All were produced at my own expense and offered
to the public at much less than cost price ; but this unscrupulous
artifice did not overcome the natural disrelish of mankind for the
combination of a tedious author with an odious editor. Of each
volume there were printed 400 copies : only the first is yet sold out,
and that took 23 years ; and the reason why it took no longer is
that it found purchasers among the unlearned, who had heard that
it contained a scurrilous preface and hoped to extract from it a low
enjoyment.

A preface to this Fifth book shall follow, but first I will take a
retrospective survey of the period3 and Ι begin with the question
of the Mss.

Of β, the second of the two families, now shrunk to a single
representative M, I need here say little beyond what will be found on
pp. 101 sq. and 104. J have satisfied myself by comparison that U and
R throughout, and V so far as it conoerns us, are scions of M, and I
have no doubt that H, though I have not read it through, is another.
They all proffer its Italian corrections as well as its original text.
But, although M is thus left alone in the witness-box, the sign β may
usefully be kept to denote its lost exemplar, the MS discovered by
Poggio 3 for a vast number of the corruptions in M have sprouted
from the pen of its ignorant and unpractised scribe and are no part
of an ancient tradition.

Of the other family, α, there are three representatives, L and G
and Gronouius' imperfect collation of the lost cod. Venetus¹ The
cod. Cusanus is none. This MS was brought into use by Jacob in
1846 and retained in the apparatus criticus by Bechert in 1900 : in
1903 Ι set it aside, but Breiter, unwilling to learn from one so much
younger than himself, brought it back in 1907. It is now gone for
ever. As Ι explain on pp. 102 sq., it is a copy of L, and is itself
the parent of Voss. 1 and of the first portion of V, which therefore
follow it into exile.

Of the three surviving witnesses L is much the most faithful, and
there is no reason to doubt that it was copied straight from α,
whereas G and Ven. must be copies of copies. The superiority of 1.
