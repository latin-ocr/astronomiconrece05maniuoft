LIBRO I ADDENDA 111

sich hat) Anyone who really does read the two pages of Firmicus
from which Mr Thielscher has snatched these two names will find
that Fronto's treatise was meant for adepts, not for beginners, and
was therefore as unlike to this poem as possible, and further that
Fronto and N auigius were not one person but two, holding opposite
opinions about antiscia, the opinions respectively of Hipparchus and
01 Ptolemy. Posterity, if there is to be a posterity for these studies,
will think that I ought to have ignored Mr Thielscher's wind-eggs ;
and it is the fault 01 0111 contemporaries that I cannot.

pp. lxix-lxxii. The merciless prolixity of which I spoke in 1903
was not checked by the example which I set of brevity and condensa-
tion but chattered implacably and unprofitably on. There was one
exception 3 and the modifications which Ι made in 1920 (at 1V 547
and 776) of what I had formerly written were due to four pages
(156—9) 01 a paper by Mr J. G. Smyly in Hermathena no. XXXVIII
(1912), 00 which I commented in the Classical Quarterly vol. V11
(1913) pp. 109-14.

Mr Smyly's contribution to the subject was to settle the exact
relation between Augustus and Capricorn to which Manilius alludes
in ΙΙ 508 sq. ‘ quid enim mirabitur ille Ι maius, in Augusti felix *

* The sense of felix is of course that Capricorn's influence, as the event
proved, was propitious ; the same sense as in Verg. buc. v 65, Prop. lv 1 83,
Firm. 11 22 4 prospera felixque radiatio, and the most appropriate of all possible
senses. But Mr W. Gundel Philol. LXXXI p. 315 interposes. ⁴ Nein, es ist der
rein astrologische Fachausdruck hier gemeint. Bei Besprechung der Octo-
tropos ’—it is not an Octotropos but a Dodecatropos—‘ sagt Manilius 11 888
von dem Platze am Himmel, der das Gliick eines Menschen entscheidet : cui
titulus felix '. False: that the undecimas locus or ἐπαναφορὰ μεσουρανήματοσ
‘ das Gliick eines Menschen entseheidet’ is private doctrine of Μι- Gundel’s‚
not to be found in Manilius; Paulus Alexandrinus says that it is ἀγαθῶν
ἐλπίδων σημαντικόο· and Valens that it is φίλων, ἐλπίδων, δωρέασ, τέκνων, σωμάτων
ἀπελευθέρων τόποσ. ‘ Daraus ergibt sich der Sinn: als κλῆροσ τύχησ hat
Capricornus in die Geburt des Augustus hineingestrahlt ⁹. Daraus! The
ἐπαναφορὰ μεσουρανήματοσ (Man. 11 881—90) has nothing whatever to do With
the κλῆροσ τύχησ (Man. 111 96—101). But leave his reasoning and come to 1110
conclusion. That Capricornus felix should mean ‘capricorn in dem locus
fortunae ’ is impossible. No sign was rendered felix by occupying the locus
fortunae, for the locus fortunae itself was no more felix than infelix. In Firm.
1v 17 5 we read ‘ ex hoc loco . . . felicitatis atque infelicitatis cursus ostendi
datum Manilius himself in 111 91 says of the twelve athla (of which it is one)
felix aut triste uenit per sinqula fatum. But further, the locus fortunae in
Manilius is no more associated with felicity and infelicity than any of the
other athla: its special province is thus defined, ΠΙ 97-100, proxima continet
in se Ι fundamenta domus domuique haerentia cuncta .· Ι qui modus in seruis, qui
sit concessus in aruis Ι quamque datum ‘maynae operum componere moles; he
understands fortuna as res familiaris or τὰ ὑπάρχοντα, not as τύχη, much less
