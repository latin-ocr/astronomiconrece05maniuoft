ORTHOGRAPHIA CODIOVM GLM

In the apparatus criticus Ι have never without special cause made
mention of purely orthographical variants, and have sometimes for
the sake of brevity ignored orthographical trifles, as in saying
‘componet GL2‚ conponit LM ⁹ at v 471, where L has componit; and
in the text I have often tacitly corrected the medieval spelling
of all Mss and have even excluded for the sake of perspicuity
forms so correct and well supported as the numeral quod and the
conjunction ad. This appendix is meant to record the legitimate
variations of the MSS and such of their errors as are not merely
barbarous. It disregards ior the most part the usual or regular
misspellings of the middle ages: their treatment of ae and e and
oe, i and y, ph and f ; their addition (very frequent in ora both
singular and plural) or subtraction of the aspirate; and such things
as menbrum and utrunque and Liquryus.
