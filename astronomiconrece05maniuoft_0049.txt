ASTRONOMICON V xliii

pp. 16—58 contain many constellations with outlandish names and
shapes‚ though the familiar Greek constellations are mixed up
with them.

That Firmicus in writing vm 6-17 had this book of Manilius
before him was observed by Scaliger ; and denial is idle. The proof
lies not in the similarity or identity of the informatiom true or false,
which they profess to impart, for in this they might be borrowing
from a common authority, but in the cases where the choice voca-
bulary and ornamental flourishes of the poet reappear in Firmicus’
prose. Man. 65 sq. ‘ limina peruolitans unumque per omnia uerbum Ι
mane salutandi portans ³, Firm. 6 2 ‘ per omnium limina matutinis
semper salutationibus peruolabunt ’ ; Man. 128 sq. ‘ ultima Lanigeri
. . . pars . . . quae totum ostendit terris atque eruit undis ', Firm. 6 7
‘ Arietis parte XXX, quae pars totum siynum supra terram semper
ostendit ' ; Man. 145 ⁶ sale mordaci dulcis quaerentia risus ³, Firm. 7 1
‘ qui salsi sermonis mordacibus dictis risus hominibus concitare
consueuerint ³ ; Man. 220—5‚ Firm. 10 1-2. Some of Firmicus’
statements are mere misinterpretations of Manilius' flowers of
speech : Man. 105 sq„ Firm. 6 4 3 Man. 113, Firm. 6 5 ; Man. 124,
Firm. 6 6. Manilius however was not the sole source from which
these Chapters of Firmicus are drawn. The proof of this does not
lie in their divergencies. Many of these may with certainty or
probability be laid at the door of Firmicus' scribes: Man. 175
Iugulae (Firm. eamae), 197 Procyon (arqion), 633 Equus (aes or aces),
39 quattuor (om.), 197 sq. uicesima . . . septimaque (XX), 339 octo (1),
365 ter decuma (x), 631 uicesima prima (xx). Some seem to be
Firmicus’ conjectural attempts at repairing Manilius' obvious
negligences : Man. 174 (1 add. Firm.), 311 (XV), 389 (primis),
416 (V111). Others, more serious, are apparently deliberate altera-
tions by Firmicus of what he found in Manilius. In Man. 449
Cepheus rises with Aquarius, but Firm. 15 4 ‘ in xv parte Capricorni '‚
which is not quite so bad. In Manilius Lyra rises with Libra at 324
and Fides with Oapricorn at 409 : Firmicus omits Lyra in the one
place and gives its name to Fides in the other, refusing to recognise
the distinction. In Manilius the Piscis Notius rises at 394 and
Delphinus, after Fides, at 416: Firmicus omits the Piscis Notius
and puts Delphinus in its place, thinking them too similar in their
nature and effects to be worth discriminating. But Firmicus in
addition makes mention of astronomical objects, and their astro-
logical effects, which are not to be found in Manilius and which
would cause some surprise if they were. 7 5 ⁴ in fissione ungulae
