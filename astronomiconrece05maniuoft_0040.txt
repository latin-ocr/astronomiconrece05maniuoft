as deplorable. Τὶιθ resistance of conservatives to true emendation
is perpetual, and to enjoy credit in the future they must obliterate
their past. When therefore a conjecture has turned out to be a
manuscript reading, and they have gnashed their teeth and accepted
it as such, they try to make the world forget that they formerly
condemned it on its merits. Its author, who bore the blame oi its
supposed falsehood, is denied mention after the establishment of its
truth 3 and the history of scholarship is mutilated to save the face
of those who have impeded progress.

There is an industriously propagated legend that many of my
own corrections are ‘ violent’ or ‘ palaeographically improbable ’,
by which it is merely meant that they alter a good number of letters*
Violence and palaeographical improbability do not consist in that ε
they consist in ignoring the habits of copyists ; and the terms
should not be used by those to whom the habits of copyists are
imperfectly known. A conjecture which alters only a single letter
may be more improbable palaeographically than one which leaves
no letter unaltered. The greatest change which I have admitted is
none of my own but Breiter's quaeue (iacent) for contra (iacet) in 11 253,
which is what Manilius must have written. It is less violent,
presume's less unwonted behaviour in the scribes, than the universally
accepted conjecture quorum for quarum in 111 300 ; and quorum has
worse features than violence. If I had to name three of my own
conjectures which I judge to be quite certain, I should be inclined
to choose Ι 423 equit I oue for esurcz‘one, IV 800 ubi ab his ope sumpta
for ubi pisce suo-upton and v 461 uix una trium for atri luzum ; two
of which, I can well believe, will make the hair stand up on many
uninstructed heads.

The first virtue of an emendation is to be true3 but the best
emendations of all are those which are both true and difficult,
emendations which no fool could find. It is humiliating to reflect
how many of the type commonly called brilliant,—-neat and pretty
changes of a letter or two—, have been lighted upon, almost fortui-
tously, by scholars whose intellectual powers were beneath the
ordinary. Textual criticism would indeed be a paradise if scribes
had confined themselves to making mistakes which Isaac Voss and
Robinson Ellis could correct. But we know by comparing one Ms
with another that they also made mistakes of a different character ;
and it is these that put a good emendator on his mettle. First he
must recognise them, then he must deal with them suitably. Anxious

* Sometimes it is merely meant that they are mine. ‘nullam reperiri posse
audaciorem libidinosioremue ' is not language which would be used of the
conjecture Caesar melius for Caesarque meus if it were anyone else’s.
