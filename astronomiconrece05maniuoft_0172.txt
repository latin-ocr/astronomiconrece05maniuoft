110 Μ. MANILII ASTRONOMICON V

The initial title of G, which occupied two lines, is erased, and a
late hand has written Manlius poeta in its stead. The title 01 L
is also in two lines, Arati philosophi astronomicon Ι liber primus
incipit; 101 praelibatio, which Bechert and Breiter add, is no part
of the title but is written in a different character opposite verse 1.
This title, which has been copied into the cod. Cusanus saec. X11, is
in an ancient hand, which according 10 Bechert de M. Man. em. rat.
p. 10 is that of the original scribe ; but it is written (or at least the
first line is) over an erasure in which traces 01 1110 0135οᾶ 1011015 (1οᾶ
according to Mr Thielscher Philol. 1907 p. 133) can still be discerned.
Underneath astronomicon Bechert detected the same word, and
some of its letters are visible even in photographs: the assertion
of Breiter vol. Ι p. iv that they are letters of verse 21 showing through
the page in reverse order 15 3 13150110οᾶ excused only by the weakness
of his eyesight. Mr Thielscher reported that Mr Ziegler and he
and Skutsch had further deciphered BOENI, and conjectured that
the line originally ran <M arci M anilii> Boem' <astro>nomicom Now,
as he wishes 10 read Boetia· in M, he is obliged to discover ΒΟΕΤΠ
3150 11010, and says in Philol. LXXXII p. 178 that the traces are too
faint to be definitely interpreted either way. I have no doubt that
they are; and Ι nurse an uneasy suspicion that they are faint
enough to be interpreted with similar indefiniteness as SOPHI, and
that the title erased may have been identical with the title super-
imposed not only in astronomicon but in Arati philosophi. There
are places in this Μ55 (101 instance II 870, 1v 120, 298, 385, 582)
where the scribe, apparently dissatisfied with his calligraphy, has
scratched out letters and then written the same letters again ; and
here his object may have been to stretch the line further to the
right, as he has done, and 50 10 make the title more symmetrical.

But Mr Thielscher Philol. LXXXII pp. 179 sq. has invented a name
of his own for the poet: ‘ das cognomen war vielleicht Fronto,
der Geschlechtsname so etwas wie Navigius ². This conjecture he
supports 35 follows. ‘ Firmicus Maternus hat ihn grundlich gekannt
und grundlich ausgeschrieben, und man hat Firmicus gescholten,
dass er wohl andere Quellen nennt, aber Manilius, seine Hauptquelle,
nicht.' The truth is that Firmicus shows no knowledge of book I
or II or ΙΙΙ 01 IV 01 Manilius, and that his borrowings 110111 Μ311. V
are contained within a few chapters of his last book, which constitute
less than 3¹5 01 1115 whole work. ⁶ Man lese Firmicus, Math. II 1-4
(Kroll-Skutsch Bd. I S. 40 f.), und man frage sich, wer wohl Fronto
sein konnte und was es mit dem vielleicht verderbten Navigius auf
