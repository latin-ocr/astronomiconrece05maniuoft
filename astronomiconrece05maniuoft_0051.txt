Libra), and to the marbles os Bianchini and Daressy (sph. tas. V and
VI) where an inner circle (the δωδεκάωροσ) shows a goat in the place
which corresponds to the place of Libra in the circle of the zodiac ;
and this τράγοσ again accompanies Libra in C.O.A.G. vm iv p. 198
15-7 (ἀσελγὲσ ἀπὸ μέρουσ) Ζυγόσ διὰ τὸν τράγον τὸν παρανατὲλλοντα.
The δωδεκάωροο· is a circle composed of the figures of twelve
animals native to Egypt, not constellations, but apparently sym-
bolising divisions of time, perhaps the stages os the lunar month:
Teucer however is pleased to treat them as παρανατὲλλοντα of the
zodiacal signs.

To Boll's identification of Haedus with this τράγοσ, accepted, like
everything else of Boll's, with shut eyes and open mouth by editors
of Manilius who cast all their care upon him, there are obvious
objections. First, the figure is named τράγοσ and not ἔριφοσ,*
and the name is more frequent than the figure. Second, its effects
answer to its name : they are not the busy alertness and sprightliness
described by Manilius, but ἀσέλγεια and πολυγονίαι (C.C.A.G. V11
p. 205 1 sq., VIII iv p. 198 15-7). Third, the supposed blunder is
extraordinary even in a poet and even in this poet. No other figure
of the δωδεκάωροο- has wandered into his pages, and there is no
other indication that he had ever so much as set eyes on this Nilotic
menagerie ; and, if he had, why was he deluded by this figure only
of the twelve 2 It will not do to say with Boll p. 387 that it was
because the τράγοσ was ‘ fast ganz gleichnamig ' with a Greek
constellation ; for other of the figures were absolutely synonymous,
κύων, ὄφισ, λέων, ταῦροσ.

But to account for this Haedus otherwise is no less difficult. It
will apparently be necessary to postulate two errors, neither probable.
First we must suppose that he misunderstood the occasional use of
Haedus and ’Ἑριφοσ instead of the plural (Hor. carm. 111 1 28 orientis
Haedi, Prop. 11 26 56 purus et Haedus erit, Ouid. art. 1 410 merqz'tur
Haedus, Lyd. ostent. Wachsm. ed. 2 p. 135 1 ὁ Ἔριφοσ ἀνίσχει,
sphaer. Empedocl. 23 Ἔριφοσ, C.G.L. 111 p. 293 31 Ἔριφοσ- Haedus)
and imagined that it was a separate star, perhaps further
confused by coming across the term ὁ ἑπόμειόσ (the second of the
two, e.g. Ptol. synt. vn 5, ed. Heib. vol. 1 ii p. 66 12 sq.) and failing
to grasp its meaning. Then, to explain why he should connect
Libra with this imaginary object, I can make no better suggestion
than that he was vaguely conscious of the irrelevant fact that
the evening rising of Haedi or Haedus took place when the sun was

* If Manilius did mistake a goat for a kid, the object in question might be

Uza (the Goat), the Babylonian name for Lyra (Pauly-Wissowa XIII pp. 2490
sq.)‚ which according to some, Manilius among them, rises with Libra.
