xlvi M. MANILII ASTRONOMICON V

in that zodiacal sign (Colum. XI 2 73, Lyd. ostent. Wachsm. ed. 2
pp. 147, 149, 184, 291, 297).

In verse 28 we are promised an account of the effects produced
by the northern and southern oonstellations not only at their rising
but also ⁴ cum merguntur in undas ², that is, as Firmicus says
vm 6 10, ‘in occasu geniturae,’ ἀντικαταδύνοντα. This promise,
if performed at all, can hardly have been performed in this book.
Considering the length of the other books, we cannot assume that
more than some 200 verses of this have been lost in the gap after
7093 and these would not afford room for the missing matter.
Scaliger supposed that it was treated in a sixth book, and that
Firminus derived from this source those sentences of his exposition
which deal with the setting of the constellations. The second of
these opinions is rightly rejected by Boll in sph. pp. 401-4. The
effects of ἀντικατάδυσισ in Firmicus, chiefly and almost wholly
confined to the manner of death, are meagre and perfunctory
invent-iona conceived in his own dull verbiage, and not conveyed
from the lively and pictorial pages of a Manilius. But Boll's argu-
ment at sph. p. 388, that because Firmicus shows no knowledge of a
sixth book of Manilius therefore Manilius wrote none, would prove
that Manilius wrote no first or second or third or fourth book.

In 710-745 we come suddenly and unexpectedly upon a truncated
piece of information which was never promised us and which has
no proper relation to the theme of the book : a classification of the
fixed stars in six orders of magnitude. This is not astrology but
descriptive astronomy, and would have found an appropriate place
in book Ι. And we have no true certainty that these verses are in
fact a portion of book v and not of some later book. The Mss do not
so inform us, for GLM have no subscriptio at the end3 and the
dimensions of the gap after 709 are undiscoverable. But the last
65 lines of book 111 have little more business in that place than these
have here : both passages are terminal ornament, and this passage is
undeniably ornamental.
