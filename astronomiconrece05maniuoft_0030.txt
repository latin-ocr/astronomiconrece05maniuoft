xxiv M. MANILII

he thought and wrote like a sane man and a grown man. His
edition therefore, when at last it came, was a severe disappointment ;
and on a general view it detracts from his merit. It was not senile,
but it showed that an edition was an undertaking beyond his powers.

His recension is to be commended in so far as it maintains a
fairly just balance between the rival MSS and avoids the bias of
Bechert on one side and of Jacob on the other; but his use and
choice of emendation was haphazard, and his own new conjectures,
extorted by the task of editing, were without exception worthless.
In his apparatus criticus he persisted in retaining the cod. Cusanus,
because he was much too old to take example by me ; he wantonly
deceived the less wary of his readers with an inaccurate collation of G,
which others had collated accurately 3 and his collation of L, which
should have been a boon and a blessing, because much fuller and
more minute than Bechert's, was an insidious peril and a pernicious
nuisance. His eyesight was evidently feeble, and did not serve
him well in collating Mss 01 correcting proofs; but that is not
enough to account for the bucketfuls of falsehood which he discharged
on an ignorant and confiding public. In book 111, which is much
the shortest book, his apparatus, consisting of fewer than 350 111108,
contains more than 110 definitely false statements : Ι do not reckon
its frequent and deceitful omissions, nor the equally deceitful
consequences of the editor’s ignorance of his trade* He says in
vol. 1 pp. x sq. ‘ sedulo caui, ne, ubi textus coniecturis mutatus
esset, quid codices exhiberent, ignoraretur ’ ; but it is far from the
truth: he has silently substituted pristis for cetus 1 433, fugientis
for fulyentis 583, atque for que 801, ubi for ubique 808, demissus for
dimissus 821, pectore for lumine 845, f. iton umquam for numquam f.
876, tibi for sibi 11 223, ferae for suae 533, quae for qua 849, furuum
for fuluum 912, and so forth. The authorship of emendations

* As when at 111 52 he implies, without intending it, that half his MSS
omit undam. For a tiny sample of this ubiquitous inexpertness take the
apparatus of his first page, just over four lines in length: Ι should premise
that it contains three misprintS‚ which are corrected at the end of vol. 11 with
a new misprint to keep the pot boiling. Verse 1 : text artes, note ‘ artes glcu ’ :
those four are all his MSS, why then the note ? because, like many another,
it is a note not on his own text but on Jacob’s, which here has artis. Verse 5 ε
text nutantis, note ‘ nutantis lu 2, imitantis u 1 ' : what then have gc ⁸? Verse 21 ε
text aestu, note ⁴ gestu lu ἰ who wants to know that ἲ and gc have the same.
Verse 22 : text rerum, note ⁵ circam u2 circum u1 (in marg. rerum) rerum ω ’;
wrong end foremost, with the lemma at the tail. Verse 23: text inmenso,
note ‘inmenso l’: what then have the other MSS ‘2 and why was there no
note at 14, where again the text has inmenso and the MSS have just what they
have here? Verse 24: text inmittit, note ‘inmittit l’: again, what have
the others ⁸?
