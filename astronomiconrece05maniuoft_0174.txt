112 M. MANILII ASTRONOMICON V

cum fulserit ortum ’ἐ ’ Capricorn was the sign in which the Moon
was situate at Augustus’ birth. He was born in the year 63 B.c.
in the month of September, and, as Ι have argued at 1V 547, 011 that
day of the month which the Romans who saw it rise and set called
IX kal. Oct. and which was by numeration the 221¹d, though Cassius
Dio LVI 30 5, accustomed to the Julian September of 30 days,
supposed it to have been the 231‘1. But the calendar at that time
appears to have been one day ahead of the sun's course, and the
birthday therefore was the day which Caesar and we should have
reckoned as the 21δῦ of the month, five days before the equinox on
the 26th. On that day (and also on the next, which Mr Smyly
himself regards as the true date) the Moon was in Oapricorn. That
Capricorn therefore might or must be deemed the natal star of
Augustus is indicated by the words os Cicero which I quoted at
11 726, de diu. 11 91 ⁴ cum . . . ortus nascentium Luna moderetur,
eaque animaduertant et notent sidera natalicia Chaldaei, quae-
cumque Lunae iuncta uideantur ', but more clearly by the parallels

as εὐτυχία. And, finally, the κλῆροσ τύχησ 111 the geniture of Augustus was
occupied not by Capricorn but by Cancer. Manilius' method of finding it,
which is that of Paulus Alexandrinus, is given in 111 176-202, and I have
explained it there on pp. vii—xi. In order to bring the κλῆροσ τύχησ to Capricorn
it is necessary to ignore what Manilius has written and to impose on his words
from without an interpretation of which they are incapable. Not yet content
with his performance, and wishing to display gratuitously his ignorance os
astronomy, Mr Gundel adds on p. 318 that the position of the planets 111 the
geniture of Augustus is unknown. It can be calculated exactly.

Fifty mortal pages of vol. LXXXI of the Philologus has this intruder been
allowed to fill with matter which he calls ‘textkritische und exegetische
Bemerkungen zu Manilius '. Because he has read a great deal more astrology
than he can digest, he supposes himself fitted to invade the criticism and
interpretation of a Latin poet, without first acquiring a knowledge of the
tongue, a tincture of literature, or a notion of what thinking means. And
mouths are open to swallow all that he may say. Listen to one of them.
Mr J. G. W. M. de Vreese published in 1927 a book on ‘ Petron 39 und die
Astrologie ³ designed to prove that Trimalchio was an adept and Petronius a
fool; and on p. 121 he thus proclaims his complete deception: ‘ Neuerdings
hat W. Gundel in Philolog. 1926 p. 313 seqq. die ganze Sache ausfiihrlich erortert
und zur endgiiltigen Losung gebracht. Im Zusammenhang mit Man. 11 509
“ 111 Augusti felix cum fulserit ortum ’³ weist Gundel darauf hin, dass nach
den astrologischen Lehren gerade dem jeni gen Sternbild, das im κλῆροσ τύχησ-
stand, der ausschlaggebende Einfluss auf das Schicksal eines Menschen zukam.
Mit dem worte “ felix ’⁷ nun deutet Manilius darauf hin, dass der zunehmende
Mond, der sich am Geburtstage des Aug. im letzten Dekan des Capricornus
befand, dort im κλῆροσ τύχησ stand.' It is not my business to run about saving
dupes from dupery : I have exhibited one sample of Mr Gundel's quality, and
that should be enough 3 it absolves me from taking any further notice of him.
