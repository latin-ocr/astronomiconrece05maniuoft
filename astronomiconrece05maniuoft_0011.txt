ASTRONOMICON V vii

deprauata esse mihi uidebatur, Lo libros arcessiui ; sed ne his quidem
sufficientibus adii VM libros in extremo potissimum carmine haud
spernendos ’. But even this idolatry was not abject enough for
Vollmer, who in Berl. Phil. Woch. 1900 pp. 1292-4 might be seen
defending interpolations and corruptions abandoned by Bechert
himself.

In 1903, on pp. xxvi—xxviii of my first volume, I demonstrated
the truth which Jacob had in vain asserted, and showed that G is a
much interpolated Ms, inferior in sincerity to L and still more to M.
This is now denied by nobody and only ignored by the ignorant.
The revolution was immediate and complete, and the revulsion
excessive. In 1904, Berl. Phil. Woch. p. 104, Vollmer rose from his
knees, renounced his saith, and stamped upon the altar 3 nam cupide
conculcatur nimis ante metutum. The slaves of words, for whom
interpolation is a name of superstitious terror, set to and disparaged
G as hard as they could; and incompetent critics‚ conscious of
their own inability to extract truth from interpolated MSS, began
to insist that it should be used as little as possible. M and L were
now to be the sole authorities ; where they agreed, that gave the
tradition ; where G in contradiction gave the truth, that was con-
jectural emendation; and ‘ hatte Housman eine Ahnung von
Uberlieferungsgeschichte ' he would have come to the same con-
clusion.

If so, my sad deficiency is a blessing in disguise. Unable to
soar in the void, I creep upon the earth; and there I make the
acquaintance of stony facts. They teach me, and in this prefaoe
I will teach the teachable, that G is not merely an independent
witness to the text of α but much more than that. For the moment
however I am considering it in this aspect only, as one of a's three
representatives.

The revolution of which I was the guilty author attained its
culmination in a boastful article ’¹¹‘ ‘ de librorum Manilianorum

* Mr Thielscher made the impression which he desired and had no cause to
be dissatisfied with his reception. ‘ Es war das Verdienst Paul Thielschers, in
das Chaos der M.-Uberlieferung Licht gebracht zu haben ⁷ said Mi· M. Schuster
in Burs. Jahresb. vol. 212 p. 89. Mr Schuster could not be expected to know
the facts, but an editor of Manilius shewed equal ignorance : van VVageningen
p. iii ‘ex iis quae Paulus Thielscher de librorum Manilianorum recensione
disputauit, satis apparet omnes illos libros . . . ex uno eodemque exemplari
fluxisse ⁷ etc. The obvious truth that the MSS of Manilius, as of most authors,
are descended from an archetype was demonstrated by Jacob in 1846 and at
greater length by Bechert in 1878. That they form two families was demon-
strated by Beehert at the same time. The chief novelties in Mr Thielscher’s
article were the errors which I am about to refute.
