xxxii M. MANILII

but he has copied 105 and possit from Bouche-Leclercq. 1-2: the reference
1ο Virgil is from Scaliger (I am not implying that acknowledgement was due).
2: the references to Plotinus and Augustino are from Bouche-Leclercq astr.
Gr. p. 600 n. 2 and p. 620 n. 3. 3 t he says that caelestis rationis opus means
‘laborem deducendi et aggrediendi ’ in apposition to the sentence, because I
said that it did not ; but at IV 390 116 forgets that fact and therefore abandons
that opinion. 4-6 aqyredior primus . . . nouis Helicona mouere Ι canti-
bus, . . . hospita sacra ferens nulli memorata priorum: Manilius says, as
he says again in books 11 and 111, that 116 16 1116 first poet to sing of astrology, a
theme new to Helicon. Van Wageningen understands him to mean that he
is the first Roman poet to sing of astrology, a theme new to Italy. This
mistake he inherited from Fayus and Breiter, and was confirmed in it by his
oracle Boll, who said that hospita meant ‘hellenisch’, as if Helicon itself
were not Hellenic. 4-5: the three references to Virgil are from Cramer de
Man. eloe. p. 62. 5—6: 116 argues against Gronouius' conjecture ad in a way
which shows that he had not read Gronouius and only knew 01 11 from others.

7: he says that Horace carm. 1 2 50 called Augustus pater patriae, which
Horace did not.

16 my addenda to books 1—1v I have borrowed from van Wagenin-
gen and Mr Garrod whatever I thought worth borrowing ; and my
superstitious practice of acknowledging obligations will enable
anyone to see how little it is. 1 will now end with a few remarks,
particular and general, on my own work, first referring the reader
to vol. Ι pp. lxxii sq., where I stated its design.

The true rule of numeration in a poet’s text is that the verses,
whatever their order, should be numbered according to their order
in the Mss 3 but it is now too late for applying it to Manilius. Lach-
mann could apply it to Lucretius in 1850, because the primitive
sequence had not been much disturbed in the editions and his
readers would not be much incommoded by the reform. But in
Manilius, whose editors have been forced to make great changes of
order, and have habitually ignored them in their numeration, reform
would bring chaos. The early editions are without numeration;
Scaliger numbered by the lines of his own pages3 continuous
numbering began with Fayus and followed the printed order of
verses in each successive recension, concealing the transpositions
which had brought it about. From 1846 to the end of the 19¹³¹¹
century the text in common use was Jacob’s, and references to
Manilius in the learned literature of all that age are according to his
numeration. 1 therefore, had 1 been his immediate successor,
should have followed it, deceptive though it was, without any diver-
gence. But Bechert in 1900 deserted it in a few places and sub-
stituted a numeration corresponding to the sequence of verses in the
Mss ε 31 1 742 743, ΙΙ 673-686, 1v 666 667, v 264—510, 514 515, 529 530,
