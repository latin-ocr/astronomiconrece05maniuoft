xxvi M. MAN ILII

much more truth than error, but it contains so much error that the
only readers who ean use it With safety are those whose knowledge
extends beyond Mr Garrod's ; though even a student quite ignorant
of the subject must discover, if intelligent and attentive, that
some things which the editor tells him, for instance at 361-70, cannot
possibly be true. What is taken at second hand is not always
verified, and Bouche-Leclercq⁷s prodigious blunder (astr. Gr. p. 374)
about Hor. carm. 1 12 50 orte Saturno is introduced at 509 as if
original. Unconscious ignorance here and there exults too merrily,
and it cannot be said that Mr Garrod’s attainment in scholarship
corresponds to his pretensions. Few will listen to a lecture at 747 sq.
on elision in Latin poetry from a metrist who has not found time to
read even his own text of one book of Manilius, and does not know
what he has printed at 3 and 275 and 341 and 385 and 542 and 860.
Few at 740, in a note which is to Supersede the authority of Lach-
mann, will want to read further than the words ‘fluuii in Aen.
111 702 =fluuji, cf. Georg. 1 482 fluujorurn ’. But this seems to be
a sort of English book which Germans admire, as they once
admired Wakefield's Lucretius, and it was greeted as ‘ Garrods
trefflicher Kommentar ⁹, ⁴ das herrliche Werk ', ‘ das vortreffliche
Buch '. There were no such bouquets for me; and perhaps ‘che'
reader will do well to consider how far my judgment of Mr Garrod's
performance may have been warped by the passion of envy.

It is comprehensible that Breiter and Mr Garrod should aspire
to edit Manilius, or a book of Manilius, and should attempt the
enterprise ; but why J akob Van Wageningen took it into his head
that the world would be the better for an edition from him, and
fetched his paste and scissors to this particular spot, I cannot
1mag1ne.

For the text which he published with Teubner in 1915 he professed
to have collated G and L himself and to have procured photographs
of M. Yet the apparatus criticus contains more than 200 false
reports of the Mss, and much of this falsehood is borrowed falsehood.
In book 111 alone there are 25 places where he has copied Breiter’s
mistakes instead of consulting the MSS themselves3 and some of
those mistakes are gross indeed ε at IV 585 tit., where L has distributis
ad siqua, Breiter, and therefore van Wageningen, cites ad siyria
descriptis The number of conjectures which he ascribes to those
who were not their authors is nearer 300 than 200 3 and although
my editions of books 1 and ΙΙ had already appeared, and correction
was there if he wanted it, he would not look. He had not learnt
to write an apparatus criticus. 1 521 text idern semper erit quoniam
