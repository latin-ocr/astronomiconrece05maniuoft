pp. x sq. When Breiter, to whom Ι sent 3 copy of my first
volume, had read the information Ι gave on these pages about the
two codd. Vrbinates, he set off post-haste for Rome, discovered them
himself, and published his discovery in the Woch. f. klass. Phil. 1904
pp. 669—72. There are therefore now in Germany two sects of
opinion concerning these Mss : some hold that they are of value and
were brought to light by Breiter, others that they are of 110 value
and were brought to light by me. Because I had called them U and R,
Breiter called them u2 and 111 ; for his statement in vol. 1 p. vi that
he followed Bechert in this notation is false. Because I had said
that they were mutually independent, he said that R might be
regarded as a copy of U. In the Class. Quart. 1907 pp. 296-8, having
obtained photographs of both, I gave further informati0n3 and I
demonstrated their mutual independence by the observation, which
Breitcr, with the MSS in his hands, had not made, that each contains
verses which the other omits.

Το U and R must now be added H, Holkhamicus 331 saec. xv,
seen by Ellis and mentioned by Mr Thielscher in Philol. 1907 pp. 127
and 129. This too is a representative of M, less faithful than U,
less unfaithful than R, but resembling U in its worst feature, its
proclivity to omit the unintelligible and the perplexing. Its
independence of both is proved by its containing 11 184 and other
verses omitted by U and 11 166 and others omitted by R, while it
omits 1V 494 and others which U and R contain*

'¹‘ Some account of H was given by Mr Garrod in the Class. Quart. 1909
