M. MANILII ASTRONOMICON V xxxix

Porph. isag. p. 200 and Psell. περὶ παριιδ. ἀναγν. (Westermann
p. 147) statements that the παρανατὲλλοντα (or -εσ) were made to
serve the purposes of astrology by Teucer Babylonius. This author,
perhaps of the 1²3t century aiter Christ, is more than a mere name
to us now that Boll in his sphaera pp. 16-58 and 490-538 has pub—
lished from Greek and Arabic MSS substantial relics of his doctrine.
In these a number of northern and southern constellations, part
Greek part Egyptian, are brought in as παρανατὲλλοντα to the
several signs of the zodiac, or, with more precision, to the several
δεκανοί or thirds of those signs (pp. 16-21, 494-538) and even to
definite degrees of the ecliptic (pp. 41-5). In the excerpts printed
on pp. 41—52 astrology is added to astronomy, and the influence
exerted by the rising of. these constellatione upon the character and
fortunes of the native is particularised as it is by Manilius. Cases
of agreement Ι have noted in my commentary : they are not remark-
able, the alleged effects being such as the names of the constellations
would suggest to any astrologer.*

It is not correct to say that the συνανατολαί of Manilius are
generally false, for in strictness they are neither false nor true, but
indeterminate. When it is declared that such and such a con-
stellation rises with such and such a degree of the ecliptic, the
statement has no meaning until we know the latitude and the date
to which it applies. If Manilius' statements apply to his own
date and to the latitude 01³ Rome, then indeed most or all of them
are false ; but he is not so imprudent as to be explicit, and he never
specifies either latitude or date. His latitude may be as far off as
Alexandria, his date may be as far off as Eudoxus. Some of his
statements are statements made by competent astronomers in other
elimes and times, but no competent astronomer ever or anywhere
made them all, and whatever truth they originally had is necessarily
lost by transference. When Scaliger says at V 39 ‘ Manilius nesciebat
quid scribebat ' his judgment is sounder than his grammar. Manilius
either gathered his συνανατολαί from various sources without grasping
their irreconcssabssity, or else he found them already gathered by
some astrologer who was no better an astronomer than himself.

* Equally without significance are the agreements between Manilius and
O.C.A.G. v i p. 188 11-21, where we have prognostics drawn by Ἀσκληπιάδησ
ὁ Μυρλεανὸσ ἐν τῇ βαρβαρικῇ σφαίρᾳ not from παρανατέλλοντα but ἐκ τῶν τῇ σελήνῃ

V 40—56), . . . κυνηὙοῐσ . . . ὁ Κύων (228-33), ὁ Ὠρίων (175-88), αἰπόλοισ . . . οὶ
