ASTRONOMICON V xiii

And now for the third and least faithful representative of α, the
cod. Venetus, of which I give an account on pp. 103 sq. That in
spite of its corruption and interpolation it is independently though
not immediately derived from σ. 0311 most clearly be shown by v 443
⁶ molliter ut liquidis per humum ponuntur in undis ' : molliter ut
MG, tollitur ut L, mollitur Ven. The reading of α must have been
mollitur ut, rightly corrected by G, whether from conjecture or
another source, wrongly and diversely altered by L and Ven. Again
at 11 368 ‘alterius ductus locus est per transita signa ⁵, where LG
have alternis and Ven. ulterius, it appears that α, like M, had alterius*
Against Mr Thielscher's particular theory (Philol. LXVI p. 119), which
he supports with no proof or argument, that Ven. was an apograph
of L, there can be adduced also this example: 111 487 multiplicans
deciens] multiplicans decens M, multiplicatis decens L, multiplica (space)
dece (space) G Ven. The reading of L is clearly legible, and, although
it is unmetrical, G does not thus omit letters for that reason, and Ven.
omits wholesale and not piecemeal. The letters were obscure in a:
the parents (γ and ὃ) of G and Ven. could not make them out at all ;
L deciphered them imperfectly. In cases such as 11 665 nec iunyitur G
Ven., ne ciuyz'tur M, nec pinyitur L, it might possibly be contended
that the true reading was restored by conjecture and was not in α.
But, as Ι said above, if the Cusanus is an apograph of L (and it
certainly is), then Ven. was not. The theory that Ven. was derived
from G has not yet been propounded.

Ι have now shown that G is an independent authority, separately
derived, like L, from α. But this, though true, is not a truth oi the
first importance ; for the chief value of G lies in what it has derived
from a source other than α. Whereas M and L are simple Mss, G is
a compound, and must be considered twice. I now leave behind
the division between M (or β) and GL (or α) and come to another line
of severance no less deep though formerly much less evident. It was
in 1907 that Breiter's full though very inaccurate collation of L
disclosed what neither Jacob nor even Bechert had enabled us to
see : the division between LM and GL2.

Some of the many readings common and peculiar to G and L2
are certainly false and obviously conjectures. Others are no less
certainly true ; and certainly true are likewise a few readings
peculiar to L² and a large number peculiar to G. Some of these
are doubtless also conjectures, and others may be ; and critics who

’⁸¹ That the Cusanus also has alterius is a delusion of Brester’s, repeated as
usual by van Wageningen.
