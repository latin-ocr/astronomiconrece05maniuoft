xliv M. MANILII

sed quem hoc studium famoso honore nobilitet. si uero sine
testimonio beniuolarum stellarum hunc locum maliuolae solae
minaci radiatione respexerint, gladiatores famosi nascentur, sed qui
post multas palmas innumerabilesque uictorias in isto pugnarum
studio minaci gladio cum magno spectantium plausu ac fauore
moriantur ³ : this is lore which I have learnt from no other teacher.
12 2 ‘ in hac parte (Librae VIII) Styx esse perhibetur ' * ε this comes
from the barbaric sphere, Teuc. Boll sph. p. 48 2 sq. (Ζυγῷ παρανα-
τέλλει) Στυγὸο- ὕδωρ. There is therefore no reason to suspect that the
verses of Manilius lost between 709 and 710 contained the constella-
tion Lychnus which appears in Firm. 17 8 and seems to be also
barbaric, perhaps identical with ὁ τὰ λύχνα φέρων 0.0.A.G. v i
p. 188 21, Boll sph. p. 42 2 sq„ ὂ κυνοκέφαλοσ· ὁ τὰ λύχνα φέρων VII
p. 195 4 Sq.‚ Boll sph. p. 16 fin.‚ ὁ κυνοκέφαλοσ· ὃσ· ἐν μὲν τῇ ἀρισ-
τερᾷ αὐτ-οὓ χειρὶ κατέχει λύχνον, ἐν δὲ τῇ δεξιᾷ ἀνοικτήριον C.O.A.G. V
i p. 157 5 sq., which is a παρανατὲλλον of Aries ; and moreover the
effects which Firmicus attributes to this Lychnus are those which
Manilius attributed to Cassiope in 522-36 and which Firmicus at that
place (16 3) omitted, whereas ὁ τὰ λύχνα φέρων according to Ascle-
piades ἁρμόσει δᾳδουχίαισ and according to Teucer δηλοῖ κανδηλάπτασ.

Of the northern and southern constellations which he enumerated
in 1 315—442 Manilius in this book omits five, Deltoton, Perseus,
Hydrus, Coruus, Flumina ; which is the more discreditable to him
because he has again mentioned three of them, Flumina and Hydrus
and Perseus, in his prooemium, uu. 14 and 16 and 22. On the other
hand he adds the Iugulae, which are part of Orion, the Hyades and
the Pliades† and Spica, which are parts of zodiacal signs, and a
Haedus and a Fides which are phantoms.

Boll's contentiori at sph. pp. 266 sq. that the Fides of Man. v 409
is ἡ δυσ-ώνυμοσ λύρα oi Teucer ib. p. 50 19 and the λύρα of p. 20 and
p. 49 33 I have refuted in my note on the verse; but the other
apparition is more of a puzzle. At 311 there rises with Libra a
third Haedus, two having already risen, as they should, with Aries
at 102. Boll sph. pp. 298 and 386 explained this interloper by
reference to Teucer Babylonius ib. pp. 47 sq. τῷ Ζυγῲ παρανατέλλει
. . . ἡνίοχοσ· καὶ τροχόσ· καὶ τρ άγοσ· and p. 19 =C.O.A.G. VII p. 204
(where ὁ τράγοσ τῆο· δωδεκαώρου is among the παρανατὲλλοντα Of

* What follows should be corrected thus: ‘inde (id est codd.) alteram
(Traube, terram codd.) Stygem esse nulla dubitatio est, <quae de caelo lapsa
terrenorum corporum sustentationibus applicatur). caelestia numina (Bon,
num in codd), exemplum timentes (al. -is : ne timentia requiras uide e. q. Isuc.

† The Hyades and Pliades are mentioned in the spurious verses 1 371 sq.
