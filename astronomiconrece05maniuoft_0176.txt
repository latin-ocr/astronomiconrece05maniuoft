114 M. MANILII ASTRONOMICON V

p. lxx ll. 18 sq. Read ‘ inperium ’ and ‘ positas '.

p. lxx 1. 35. P. L. M. Baehr. 1v p. 144=anth. Lat. Ries. 618.

p. lxxii l. 24. For Boeni read Boeiii.

p. lxxiii ll. 9-19. Nothing in this scandalous preface gave more
scandal than my disrespect towards Quellenforschuny in general
and Posidonius in particular: poor Posidonius, whose epitaph is
‘ For O ! for O ! the hobby-horse is forgot.' In 1903 the earth was
overrun by those who are now derided as ‘ Pamposidonisten ', and
it was presumptuous ignorance to doubt that the tabernacle of
contemporary dogma was a mansion for eternity. An investigation
of the sources whence Manilius may have derived his physics and
cosmology, even if it were soberly conducted and could ascertain
them definitely, would be a mere appendix to such an edition as
mine3 and perhaps he was not always kind enough to consult only
books and authors whose names we were destined to know.

p. lxxiii ll. 31 sq. The succeeding editors Breiter and van
Wageningen learnt from me how to spell Phrixei ; but I did not tell
them how to spell Tydiden 01· Arachnaeo, so they never knew.

p. lxxiv l. 3. For ‘ summa ⁹ read ‘ summa, es '.

p. lxxiv ll. 4 sqq. This note is augmented, and corrected by the
omission of Appul. met. 111 19, in my edition of book 1v.

p. lxxvi l. 1. For ‘ Gemblacencis ' read ‘ Gemblacensis ’.

one of the Stosch collection ‘in thesauro regio gemmarum Berolinensi ’‚ class.
1v 2 n. 220, as having Tiberius' head on one side and a scorpion on the other ;
but I learn from Mr A. S. F. Gow that according to Furtwaengler the head
on this stone, now Berol. 6446, is not Tiberius’ but a Greek’s of the Hellenistic
age, and the scorpion is a late addition. Von Domaszewski further contends
that the scorpion shown on the standard of the third praetorian cohort in his
Fahnen im romischen Heere, p. 31 fig. 5 (Zoega Bassirih'evi 1 tav. 16, C.I.L. XIV
2523), is there too the natal star of Tiberius, and he exerts himself to forge a
link between Tiberius and the praetorians. But his attempts to establish
relations between the nativities of emperors and the devices on military
standards are not very successful. Some of these devices, Pegasus, the boar,
and the stork, are not zodiacal signs at all. When Capricorn appears on the
standard of the legio ΙΙ Augusta, then indeed the connexion is evident; but
when the 1v Flauia has a lion on its standard and he promptly conjectures that
‘ der Lowe in der Stunde von Vespasians Geburt als Horoscop am Osthimmel
stand ‘, there are two comments to be made. First, the imperial forces were
capricious astrologers if they fixed Augustus' natal star (as they did) by the
Moon, Tiberius ' (as he supposes) by the Sun, and Vespasian's (as he now will
have it) by the horoscope. Secondly we leam from Suet. Vesp. 2 l that
Vespasian's horoscope was not in Leo. He was born ΔΑ). 9 ‘ xv kal. Dec.
uesperi ⁵ : the horoscope was therefore in Taurus (or an adjacent sign), the
Moon in Anes, and the Sun in Scorpius 3 and Leo, except as belonging to the
square of Taurus, was out of action.
