ASTRONOMICON V xv

In some cases the source seems to lie even beyond the common
parent of α. and β. In vol. 1 p. xxv I gave a small selection from
the many readings offered by G alone which are accepted, and must
be, by all editors ; and together with them I cited three significant
corruptions.

11 494—ss :
Cancer et aduerso Capricornus conditus astro

in semet uertunt oculos, iu mutua tendunt
auribus.

uertitur oeulis in mula Μ, uertitur oculis immutaque L; whence it
appears that not only β but the archetype had the same as M, and
that L or rather α. made a faint attempt to better the metre. The
11⁸² century, continuing the effort, made the transposition uertitur
iu semet L2. Gr has uertunt oculusque (-us corr. in -os) in mutua.
This is not a conjecture, for the scribe himself could not interpret
it: he has underlined uertunt and written the sign of query in the
margin. It is a slight corruption of the true and original reading,
otherwise and worse corrupted in the source of α and β.

IV 282 ε
iamque huc atque illue aqilem conuertere clauum.

illuc al iqem G, hue caliyz‘nem L, huc ealigine M. α. and the archetype
had the same as L, β or M subtracted a letter. The reading of G
is an earlier stage of the corruption.

v 545 s . :
hicqhymenaeus erat, solataque publica damna
priuatis lacrimans ornatur uictima poenae.

solaque G, solaque iu LM. The unmetrical reading of G was the first
error, and the reading of LM is an attempt to correct it.

It is therefore clear that G preserves truth not preserved else-
where ; and when, for instance, G alone offers the true reading
Iouis et for iuuisse at 11 15 or peploque fluenti for populoque fluentis
at v 392, those are much rather portions of this truth than emenda-
tions anticipating in the Hm century the perspicacity and deftness
of the 15³¹ ; or again when GL2 offer eaeterz'us mirantur for extermin-
antur at 11 168 or uictricem Ebusum for uictrice mebus usum at IV 640
(where Μ2 even in the 15ὼ century could do no better than melius)
or terya for aer at V 104.

If any future editor should seriously attempt what van Wagem'n-
gen merely professed to do, and. try to carry out in his recension the
precepts of Vollmer and Mr Thielscher‚ he would find a formidable
