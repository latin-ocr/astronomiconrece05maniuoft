106 Μ. MANILII ASTRONOMICON V

have said with emphasis, as I do now, that he was very accurate
indeed.

p. xxii l. 31. Bechert's selection from the readings of L was by
no means ⁶ adequate '.

p. xxiii ll. 18 sq. It is probable that Μ, that is to say β, had
correctly siywzaft, as R has, at 1 53 ; and at 148 its original reading
was habilis.

p. xxiii ll. 31 sq. Delete ‘ 136 suspensa ' etc.

p. xxiii ll. 33 sq. Delete ‘ 505 aequorei ' eto.

p. xxiv l. 15. In 111 32 casus is omitted not only by M but by L
and therefore probably was not in α..

p. xxv ll. 1-6. From these examples of L’s superiority to G and M
must be subtracted 1 545, where G like L has quacumque, 1V 400,
where L like G has consumant and the true reading is M’s consument,
and perhaps 882 ; but the following may be added. 1 141 nec L,

It is probable that 1V 894 and a few others are conjectures.

p. xxv ll. 10—2. M like V has destituente iustum at 11 735 and
σοφαί at IV 919.

p. xxv 11. 38 sq. G's reading at 11 290 is, and L's apparently waS,
the same as M’s.

p. xxv 1. 41. Α1) 111 136 M has not quamque but queque.

p. xxvi 1. 4. For 327 read 326. At V 363 M has not limine but
lumine, and therefore is not better than GL.

p. xxvi l. 13. For confluaeit read conflixit. I must now add, what
Thomas and Bechert did not record, that G omits que in 910 and
M does not.

p. xxvi 1. 20. possidet is merely a false report of Ellis’s.

p. xxvi l. 23. de toto is from M2 rather than M, which seems to
have had deltoto. To these examples of interpolation in M may be
added 11 39 ritus pastorum] ritus pecorum L Ven., pecorum ritus GM,
1V 347 at qui] atque L, atque in M.
