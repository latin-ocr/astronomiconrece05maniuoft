ASTRONOMICON V xxxv

adherence to the ductus litterarum is the fruitful parent of false
conjectures. It seduced even such men as Scaliger and Porson z it
led Scaliger to write ultimus ex solido tetrans in IV 7573 it made
Porson spoil his famous correction of Eur. Ion 1115 by omitting a
necessary particle. The merits essential to a correction are those
without which it cannot be true, and closeness to the Mss is not one
of them3 the indispensable things are fitness to the context and
propriety to the genius of the author. The question whether the
error presupposed was great or small is indeed a question to be asked,
but it is the last question. With vulgar judges it is the first, though
usually the last as well. This detail is their favourite criterion,
because it can be discerned, or they think it can, by a bodily sense,
without disturbing the slumbers of the intellect.

It surprises me that so many people should feel themselves
qualified to weigh conjectures in their balance and to pronounce
them good or bad, probable or improbable. J udging an emendation
requires in some measure the same qualities as emendation itself, and
the requirement is formidable. To read attentively, think correctly,
omit no relevant consideration, and repress sels-will, are not ordinary
accomplishments; yet an emendator needs much besides: just
literary perception, congenial intimacy with the author, experience
which must have been won by study, and mother wit which he must
have brought from his mother's womb.

It may be asked whether Ι think that I myself possess this
outfit, or even most of it; and if I answer yes, that will be a
new example of my notorious arrogance. I had rather be arrogant
than impudent. I should not have undertaken to edit Manilius
unless I had believed that I was fit for the task ; and in particular
Ι think myself a better judge of emendation, both when to emend
and how to emend, than most others.

The following stanza of Mr de la Mare’s ⁴ Fare well ' first met
my eyes, thus printed, in a newspaper review.

Oh, when this my dust surrenders

Hand, foot, lip, to dust again,

May these loved and loving faces
Please other men ἱ

May the rustling harvest hedgerow

Still the Traveller’s J oy entwine,

And as happy children gather
Posies once mine.

I knew in a moment that Mr de la Mare had not written rustling, and
in another moment I had found the true word. But if the book of
