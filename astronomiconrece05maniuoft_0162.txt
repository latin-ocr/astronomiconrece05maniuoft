p. vii l. 4. Traube Philol. 1907 p. 122 formed from photographa.
the opinion that G, like L, belongs to the 11ῖὴ century and that L is

somewhat the older of the two.
p. vii 1. 5. I now have photographs of G, which show that Mr

Thomas’ collation was very accurate.

p. vii 1. 7. For 1456 read 1465.
p. vii l. 11 ⁵ the hand of its original scribe ³. So said Bechert de

M. Man. emend. p. 10 ; but it is not so. Before the publication of
my second volume I procured photographs of L, and they show that
Jacob p. vi was right in distinguishing the corrector, whose hand,
though nearly coeval and generally similar, is not only smaller
(sometimes of necessity) but more elegant, and differs in its formation
of certain letters, especially s. Further I agree with Mr P. Thielscher
Philol. 1907 p. 111 that this chief corrector is not the only one ; and
in particular Ι must separate from the older hands, contemporary
or nearly so with one another, some emendations in pale ink at
1 657, 684, 11 186, 431, 476, 491, 764, 799, 111 4, 199, 344, 385, 418,
IV 126, 203, 263, 298, 550, 718, which are not earlier than 1250 and
ought not to be included under the title of L2. I also agree with Jacob
and Breiter that portions of the text are from hands other than that
which wrote most of it, and with Mr Thielscher that those portions
are the fifth book and a page or two of the third 3 but this is a matter
of no importance for textual criticism.

A detail which deserves mention should perhaps be mentioned
here. The diphthong ae is often written e or ς, but the ligature ae,
if Ι am not mistaken, is original only in the (ether of V 743 : wherever
else it occurs, as in the mensurae of IV 205, it is a correction of a, as
comparison will show, and sometimes means not ae but e, as in

V 572, where andromachem is changed to awdromoeden.
p. vii l. 14. quanto in 111 344 is not from L2 but from the late

hand of which I have just spoken : substitute therefore IV 243 uesta
