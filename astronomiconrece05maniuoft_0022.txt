task confronting him. For his benefit and intimidation let me
point out one small part of it. The following words, Π 750 cuncta,
111 32 casus, 274 ora, 1v 680 hanc, v 157 uero, 198 sese, and many
lesser ones, now printed in all editionS, are absent from LM and
repose on the sole authority of GL2.

What may be the origin of genuine readings which were neither
in α nor in β, and how they found their way into G or GL2‚ I do not
know, and therefore, having no inkling of Ueberlz'eferunqsyeschichte,
I will not pretend to know. Π Ι formulate an hypothesis which
would explain the facts, I beg that it may not be called my hypo-
thesiS. These readings, then, may have been in the margin of the
archetype 3 they may thence have been copied into the margin of α
and not of β, and thence into the text of γ and not of L. Catullus
affords a parallel. The variants in the margin of his archetype
were ignored by Ο but survive in the margins of G and R, whence
some of them, even though obviously corrupt, have found their way
into the text of later MSS. At 64 23 Ο has simply mater, G and R
have mater with the variant matre, which is nearer to the true reading
matrum preserved in the Veronese scholia of Virgil ; and this matre,
though meaningless, appears in the text of Laur. xxxin 12. At 1 8
Ο has libelli, G libelli al. mei, Laur. mei, unmetrical though it is.
At 64 324 O has only tutum opus, G and R have also the marginal
variant tu tamen opis, which a few MSS therefore exhibit in their text.
And in Manilius three or four of G's true and unique readings are
offered by itself as variants : 1 26 munera uel e, ΙΙ 584 leuis uel lis,
v 372 nitidos clamare uel nidis damnare, 408 insitor uel institor.
This hypothesis however will hardly account for what we find at
v 545, where the virtue of. G resides in the mere absence of an inter-
polated word; and there it is conceivable that solaque without in
was the reading of the archetype, preserved in o. and transmitted
to G, and that β and L hit independently on the same false conjecture.

There are about 20 MSS of the 15⁸²h century beside M. M's only
progeny are URH and the latter and larger part of V. All the rest, So
far as known, are descendants of α and apparently of the Cusanus.*
This strain is pure, or virtually so, in the first part of V, in Voss. l,
and in the Venetian cod. Marc. XII 69 whence some lections are

* There are none of G, and the Venetus seems to have perished without
issue; for its agreement here and there with later MSS, 1 90 alia-s Flor. Bodl„

statement, p. liv, that Bentley’s δ has 1 13 altum, 813 euentus, 11 29 solantem,
is an error.
