The archetype need not have been older than the 10th century.
Words were sometimes separated (1v 692 stupefacta LM), sometimes
continuous (v 366 nitidis olore uolantis L, uttibz' solore nola talis M).
Indieations 01 its script, as usual, are uncertain. Such a confusion
as v 544 teneros L, tenepos M might seem to signify that it was Irish
or at any rate insular ; but similarly such confusions as Lucr. 1 830
homoeomerian Q, homofomerz'an O and v 1337 eorum O, forum Q
were taken by Lachmann 101· evidence that the Lucretian archetype
was in capitale, whereas there is much more reason to think that it
was not. That the text 01 Manilius has passed through an insular
stage is likely enough, and such errors as v 655 porulum for populum
and 687 aepa 101· area may be traces 01 it, though pompa rependit
101· roma pependit in 1 917 is probably a case 01 transposition.

Some scholars think that they know much more than this about
the archetype, especially about its pagination, and fancy that
light is thrown upon this subject by certain transpositions in the
first book, detected and corrected by Scaliger and recognised by
Jacob in progr. Lubec. 1832 pp. 18-21 as transpositions 01 entire
leaves. My observation saved me from this mistake, and my kind
heart made me wish to save others ; so in my note at 1 529 Ι issued
the warning that the leaves transposed were not leaves 01 the

* Fayus' emendations, to which in 1903 Ι did less than justice, 101· they
excel Huetius’ both in number and in quality, present something 01 a puzzle.
He lays explicit claim only to nine 01 them ; one, 1v 781, he ascribes wrongly
to others3 one, 11 268, he ignores 'm his paraphrase3 and the rest he treats
as 11 they were MS readings.

† My praise 01 Jacob's emendations, which annoyed Ellis, was thoroughly
deserved, and 1 have a good reason of my own 101· respecting them. When Ι
first sat down to read Manilius through, Ι provided myself with the Delphin
edition, Thomas's collation 01 G, and Ellis's so-called collation 01 Μ ; and thus
equipped I found out 101· myself more than half 01 those emendations 01 Scaliger
which Fayus did not record, about one third 01 Bentley's, and almost au 01
Breiter's and Ellis's and their fellows' ; but 01 Jacob’s hardly one or two.
