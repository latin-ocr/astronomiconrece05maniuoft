In his Fifth book Manilius rehearses the diurnal risings of the
extra-zodiacal constellations, specifies or forgets to specify the
degree of the ecliptic which rises simultaneously with each, and
describes the various qualities engendered by these postures of the
heavens in children born at the moment of their occurrence. Here
therefore the horoscope or ascendant, first made prominent in IV
502—84, has become the controlling element in the geniture, although
in IV 122-293, as Ι have now pointed out, the sign occupied by the
Moon appears to be that which stamps its character on the native.
The zodiacal Sigus are here δωδεκατημόρια, not ζῴδια (ἀστερισμοί),
or they would not contain, as they evidently do, 30 degrees each.

The συνανατολαί and ἇντικαταδύσεισ· Of the northern and southern
constellations, their rising with and setting opposite the several
signs of the zodiac, are the subject of Arat. 559—732. But the aim
of Aratus in writing that section of his poem is that men may be
able to tell the hour of the night if the zodiacal sign itself is hidden
by clouds or mountains, and he is content to name the sign without
specifying the degree. Both he and his authority Eudoxus, whom
he did not rightly understand, are sharply criticised and convicted
of much grave error by Hipparchus in his Ἀράτου καὶ Εὐδόξου φαινο-
μένων ἐξήγησισ, where he professes to set forth the true συνανατολαί
and a great deal else with a precision which takes count even of
half—degrees of the ecliptic.

συνανατέλλειν has a later synonym παρανατὲλλειν (Seru. georg.
1 218 Oanis paranatellon est Cancri, z‘d est cum eo oritur), and this
was the term employed by those astrologers who took into account
the influences of extra-zodiacal constellations and made them
ingredients in the geniture. Its meaning was rightly explained by
Salmasius ann. clim. p. 586, and on pp. 554 sq. 116 cited from
