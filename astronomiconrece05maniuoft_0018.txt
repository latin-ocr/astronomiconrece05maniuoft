xii M. MANILII

Having established that G is no copy of L but a separate scion 01 α, Ι will
now produce a few examples of what may seem at first sight to be contrary
evidence; and they shall be more plausible than any 01 Mr Thjelscher'a

Mr Thielscher’s best was v 101 notanda] conanda M, conanda L, cananda G,
where it is possible and even probable that G has negligently copied a Ms which
gave just what L gives3 but there is no reason why that MS should not have
been γ. The following case is similar but more striking, v 326 oeaqrius M,

oe'brius L, oe yraizcs G ε 1118 correction in L might well be thus misinterpreted
by a scribe who knew the word Graius and did not know Oeaqrius. But on the
other hand oeqrius may have been the reading 01 γ and even 01 α. 88 it was of L,
and γ2 may have corrected it as L² djd3 or again α. may have had oeayrius,
and γ 01 G may have transposed one letter in the fashion which 1 illustrated
80 copiously on pp. liv sq. 01 my first volume. v 536 alterum M, alt-um L,
alta ni G : this is evidently a misunderstanding 01 1118 abbreviation found in L ;
but that abbreviation may have been also in ο. and even in the archetype.
V 715 ;

Mflexos per lubrica terya

L² flexos in lubrica terqa

flexos in

L lubrica Α terqa

G lubrica flexos in terqa.
Certainly 11 G had been copied from L it would be expected to give just this
reading (though the Cusanus, indisputably copied from L, gives flexos lubrica
in lerqa) ; but lubrica flexos in terqa may have been the reading 01 α, better
copied in G than in L; and that the reading of α, was indeed unmetrical or
somehow faulty may be surmised from the fact that Ven. omits the words.
IV 796 aestibus M, astibus L, ictibus L2, letibus G is peculiar in that the Cusanus
also gives letibus. But its scribe was much to blame, for in the ictibus of L²
the c at any rate is so good and clear that it might be thought unmistakable‚
and it is hardly possible that another scribe miscopied it in the same way.

As a warning against hasty inferences from such examples Ι add a case
which likewise at first sight may seem to indicate that G was copied from L
but which on examination is found to be part of the evidence that it was not.
iv 164 reflecte L, reflectit L2, reflectiet (reflecti‚‘) G : G's reading is a misapprehen-

sion of reflectgz that is how the correction was made in its exemplar. But in
L it is not so made: the e is altered into i and t is added, and the Cusanus
consequently has reflectit.

But, apart from this detailed refutation by an adversary, Mr
Thielscher's theory that G is an apograph 01 L will have to fight 101·
118 1118 against two other of his theories: the equally false theory
that Ven. was an apograph of L, and the true theory that the Cusanus
is. If these three Μ88 had been copied from any one MS, the width
01 their divergency, which no apparatus criticus reveals‚ would be
inexplicable. Its explanation is that they are copies of three
several copies 01 α; 11181 they have not a common parent but only
a common grandparent. And the reason why the Cusanus is so
much closer to L than the others are is that it was really copied
from L and they were not.
