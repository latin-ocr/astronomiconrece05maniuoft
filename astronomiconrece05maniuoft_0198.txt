136 M. MANILII ASTRONOMICON V

ἀγαθὸν ποιεῖ ἐπηρμένον οὔτε κακόν. Papyr. astrol. ClaSS. Philol. 1927
p. 25, frag. 6 17-21, is to be written and punctuated thus : οἲ
κακοποιοὶ (οἷο-τέρεα) τετράγωνοι καὶ διάμετροι εὐτονώτατοί εἰσιν εἰσ·
τὸ βλάπτειν [τὸ θέμα, τρίγων]οι δὲ ἀβλαβεῖσ εἶσιν. οἳ δὲ ἀγαθοποιοὶ
[τρίγων]οι ὠφελιμώτατοι, τετράγωνοι [δὲ καὶ] διάμετροι ἀτονώτεροι.

p. XV uu. 395432. C.C¹.A.G. VI p. 62 14 sq. ἒν τοῖο· διαμέτρυισ
οῖ μὲν κακοποιοί εἰσι χαλεποὶ, οἱ δὲ ἀγαθοποιοὶ οὔδαμῶσ κακοί.

p. xviii uu. 485—519. For uidencia and audientia add papyr.
astrol. Class. Phil. 1927 pp. 17 sq., 2 Β 13-44, which I have corrected
ib. pp. 260 sq. There is strange stuff under this title in Firm. vm 3.
My corrections of Heph. Theb. 11 22 as given in O.C.A.G. vi p. 100 are
confirmed by 0.0.A.G. vr11 ii p. 89, where that chapter recurs.

p. XXiV. τὰ δωδεκατημόρια τῶν ἀστέρων and similar berms occul·
also in C.O.A.G. vm iii pp. 106, 116, vm iv pp. 48, 119, 123, 127,
133, 155 sq„ 184 sq„ 195, 215, 216, 219.

p. xxv 1. 29. For ‘ twelve' κλῆροι, which is Manilius' number,
I should rather have said ‘seven ', which is the number in Paul.
Alex. K 2.

p. xxviii uu. 841-855. The seasons of life are distributed through
the twelve τόποι, which fill the same space as the four τεταρτη-
μόρια, in Porph. isag. p. 202 and O.C.A.G. vm iv p. 231 24-33, where
τούτου in l. 24 should be ταύτησ.

p. xxix uu. 856-967. δωδεκάτροποσ occurs also in C.O.A.G. 1
p. 72 (=Ludw. Maxim. p. 126 fin.)‚ 1v p. 43, vi p. 68, vm i pp. 100,
101, 121, 122, 123, 124, iv p. 126 12 (see app. crit.), and δωδεκατροπία
in vm iii p. 107 31 sq. In vm i p. 246 21 sq. δωδεκατρόπου is given
by both MSS at one place and by the older MS at both places, but at
one the younger has δωδεκατόπου, so that Scaliger is not, as I
supposed, the first inventor of this form. Mr Cumont corrupts the
spelling when he observes it, but it more often escapes his notice.

BOOK 11: APPARATVS CRITIOVS

As the reports of L and M in books 11 and 111 and 1v were my own,
the corrections to be made in the apparatus criticus are so few and
insignificant that they need not be separated from the corrections
and augmentations of the commentary. But in this book, not in
the two others, Ι have to add certain lections, not known to me in
1912, of the Venetus and of the later Mss collated by Bentley.
