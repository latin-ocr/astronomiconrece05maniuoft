nor did Ι assign its merit to Breiter, for it was 1 myseli who made it.
Ellis did not say what V followed 3 he expressly declined to attempt
an explanation of the phenomenon presented, and could not even.
make up his mind whether V or M was the composite MS. See
Hermathena 1893 pp. 267 and 270. The observation that M and V
are in close agreement only after a certain point in book 11 was made
by Breiter and Ellis simultaneously ; the observation that V before
that point is inferior and unimportant was made by Breiter and not
by Ellis. This was the truth which I stated, and which did not lend
itself to Mr Garrod's purpose.

Mr Thielscher in Philol. 1907 p. 118 has not, like Bechert,
ignored Breiter's observation, but has ignored its truth, and has
preferred his own fancies to the fact which Breiter pointed out.

p. ix 11. 1-33. That the Cusanus is a copy of L itself, not of a MS
resembling L, was shown by Mr Thielscher Philol. 1907 p. 128. Breiter
in 1854, de em. Man. p. 3, had noted that-at 111 399, where 1V 10-313
are interposed in the family α, the Cusanus has these words (I correct
his errors) : hic male est ordinata lectio. sed siuis eius ordinem
rectum reperire, memento earn per ordinem alfabeti quaerere quo eam
denotauirnus. post hunc enim uersum ⁴ uicino tribuat p. c. t. l.’ debet
ille sequi quern inueneris post sex folia B littera denotatum, uidelicet
istum ⁴ at quae nocturnis f. in. t.' He observed that this letter B was
nowhere to be found, and that the verse at quae nocturnis occurred
not ⁶ post sex folia' but post unum; and he drew the obvious
inference ‘ apparet librarium ea uerba in margine eius quem de-
scriberet libri inuenisse ⁹. But, though he remarked that L also
has a marginal note at this place, he did not remark that its marginal
note is the same, and that in L the verse at quae nocturnis does occur
‘ post sex folia ' and has against it the letter B. This fact was
noted in 1878 by Bechert de M. Man. em. rat. p. 23, but without any
reference to the Cusanus; and not till 1907 was the comparison
made (by Breiter as well as ΜΓ Thielscher) and the consequence drawn
(not by Breiter) that the Cusanus is derived from L. It is certain,
and needs no confirmation ; but confirmation may be found in what
the two Mss present at Ι 186 sqq. and 223 sq.

Mr Thielscher affirms in Philol. 1907 p. 116 and Rhein. Mus. 1907
pp. 49 sq. that the Cusanus was copied directly and without inter-
mediary from L ; and this I judge to be true. I have indeed observed
a few places where Cus. agrees with G and not with L or L2, such as
