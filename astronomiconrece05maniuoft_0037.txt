ASTRONOMICON V xxxi

he informs us that uertice means uertice septentrionali, that quam uertice septen-
trionali means quam est uertex septentrionalis (this he calls ‘ comparatio com-
pendiaria ‘, which is the name for κόμαι Χαρίτεσσιν ὁμοῖαι, but he is confusedly
thinking of the ablatiuus comparationis, melior fratre for melior quam frater
est, and thence creating a third form melior quam fratre), and finally that
cardine lam simili quam uertex septentrionalis est means cardine uerticis septen-
trionalis simili.

He does not shrink from open falsehood. 1 432 ‘ ut olim, cum Iuppiter
Aram constituit, maxima erant sidera, quibus usus est, sic nunc quoque
maxima manserunt (moneo propter Bentleium, qui legit: fulqet) ’. To have
written this under any circumstances would have been to profess gross and
wilful ignorance of the starry heavens: to write it after Bentley's note is
something worse. 111 325 ‘qui fastigia terrae rotundae conscendit, ei motus
grauis est '. Not only do we all know from experience that this is false, but
Manilius himself in this very passage, 328 sq. orbem scandens . . . rolandum Ι
deqrecliere simul, and in three other verses, 1 205, 233, 241, has taken the trouble
to say that the curve of the globe is no more uphill than downhill. But van
Wageningen had to choose between contradicting the notorious truth and
abandoning a stupid conjecture which he had formerly adopted from Breiter ;
and this is how he chose. IV 6064) ‘ mare per fretum Siculum se effundit in
mare apertum Ionium, sed prius pontus mare Hadriaticum efficit ’. If he is
willing to say this ior the sake of a conjecture of his own, it is only bare decency
to do as much for a lection of the Mss; and at 1v 637 he again ventures to
hope that his readers have no maps, and tells them that the Cyclades are ‘ inter
se congruentes magnitudine ³.

His opinions, not being his own, were not permanently held, but picked
up and dropped again, and he lived from hand to mouth on the borrowed
beliefs of the moment. On p. 263 116 says of book V ‘ occasuum commemoratio,
quae fortasse ducentos uersus complectebatur, interiit ' ; 011 Ρ. 265 116 repeats
the statement, ‘ haec pars libri quinti, ut iam supra animaduerti, in lacuna,
quae uersum 710 excipit, interiit ’ ; but when 116 comes to that verse, 011 p. 317,
he says, ‘ de occasu. . . siderum . . . nihil erat in hac parte carminis, ut
optime demonstrauit Bollius '. 1 801 ‘ et . . . que non defendi potest ’:
ΠΙ 851 ‘ et respondet sequenti coniunctioni que (cf. Ι 801) ’. 11 501 ‘ Libra . . .
se ipsam uidet ’ : on the same page ⁴ Libra se ipsum audit, Arietem uidet.' At
ΙΙΙ 189 116 gives ducere a particular sense and renders it by ἀπολύειν ; 011 the
same page he says that ἀπολύειν has only the opposite sense, citing Bouche-
Leclercq as 1116 authority ; and what Bouche-Leclercq says is that it has both
senses equally. IV 186 mores lucrentur: ‘ e moribus suis lucrum faciant,
cf. v 320: poenamque lucretur ⁹ : when he gets to that verse he explains it
not as ‘ e poena lucrum faciat ‘ but as ‘ scelus impune committat ’. At IV 283
de says that effindere depends on necesse est 281, not knowing that in his text
he has given Jacob's punctuation, which obliges it to depend on attribuunt 289.
IV 797-9 ‘ supra Aegyptus (752) sub Ariete erat, mox sub Scorpione (779) ’ :
but at that verse he had said ‘ Aeqypti latus: Cyrenen ’. v 45 ‘ cf. IV 109:
fraudare in praemia ’: turn thither, and you find in praemia explained as
depending not on fraudare but on donis.

Hitherto I have been ranging through the commentary at large and culling
samples of its quality : now, to show that I have made no unsair selection, Ι
will examine its texture in the first two pages. 1 1 ε 116 cites ‘ 11 105 quis caelum
possit nisi caeli munere nosse ’ : the verse is 115 and his own text gives posset,
