with L. In the few places where M agrees with G in the older 101111
and L presents the later, it is a still more certain inserence that G
is preserving, and L has altered, the spelling 01 ας 101 L sometimes
modernises, giving affectus and similes where M has adfectus and
similis, but G never gives the old forms where M has the new.
Therefore at v 38 iri iynis G, unquis M, iu iynes L, the spelling 01 G
comes from ας and so too at 111 269, 663, v 98 inp· GM, imp- L.

The adverb idcirco appears in 12 places. In all 01 them it is so
spelt by Μ, and in 11 by L ; and when G in 8 01 the 11 offers iccirco
we set its testimony aside. When therefore at 111 525 L gives iccirco
and G together with M idcirco, against its usual inelination, we infer
that G and not L is here true to α.

The nominative or vocative 01 Iouis occurs 10 times. G and L
agree once in Iuppiter and once in Iupiter. In 4 verses L has pp
and G p; and M (except once where it is quite corrupt) agrees
with L. In 4 other verses L has p and G pp, and in all 01 them M
agrees with G, though in one it has ippicer. It is to be concluded
that in all 8 verses α had the true spelling and that G's pp is thence
derived.

Even outside the department of orthography there is at least
one place where the agreement 01 M with G in a true reading conducta
us to the text 01 α. 1 520 :

nec motus puncto curuat cursusque fatigat.

puncto curuat M, ponto curuat G, ponto currat L, ponti cum! Ven.
G's curuot is no conjecture, 101 it needs puncto to make it intelligible :
it is the reading 01 α, diversely corrupted in L and Ven. ; 101· Ι already
assume, what Ι shall presently prove, that Ven. also is independently
derived from α.

Μ1 Thielscher himself allows, or rather did allow in 1907 (Philol.
LXVI pp. 114 sq.)‚ that some 01 G’s capitula must have come not
from L but from the archetype. Most 01 L's capitula are 01 later date
than G, and some 01 G's differ 110111 L's and agree with M's. The
two most noteworthy examples are 11 297 de mensura eorum sisyn il iter
atque partiliter GM, de mensura triyouorum et quadratorum iu partes L
(not only at the verse but in the list prefixed to book 11), and 1v 866
fatorum rationem perspici posse GM, quomodo possimus fatorum
rationem perspicere L. In 1926 (LXXXII pp. 174 sq.) he preferred to
hope that these capitula may have been on the first leaf 01 L, now
lost, and that G went there to find them.*

²⁸ Bechert de Man. em. rat. p. 10 n. 9 had more reasonably suggested that
this leaf contained a list 01 the capitula 01 book 1 like that prefixed to book 11.
