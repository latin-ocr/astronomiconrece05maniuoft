ASTRONOMICON V xxv

accepted is never mentioned in the apparatus and not usually in the
commentary either; hundreds which belong to others are thus
tacitly claimed for his own, and a good few even explicitly. The
verse V 17 has totally disappeared.

The commentary is plain and concise, but meagre, and a student
without other resource would starve on it. It makes no pretence
whatever to ‘ wissenschaftlichen Wert ³. Breiter’s chief purpose
was to explain for novices the astrology of the poem, but his know—
ledge of the subject was neither original nor adequate. Verba]
interpretation is often lacking, critical discussion is generally
shunned‚ and Latinity gets little attention. Falsehoods, blunders
of every sort and size, sels-contradictions, misinterpretations, mis-
calculations, misquotations and misprints leave few pages undis-
figured.

In 1911 an elaborate edition of the Second book was produced
by Mr H. W. Garrod. I declined to review it on its publication,
leaving it a fair field in which it received no competent criticism
except from Mr J. G. Smyly in Hermathena 1912 pp. 137-68. Mr
Garrod brought to his task activity and energy, a brisk intelligence,
and a strong desire to shine. His book, unlike the work of a later
editor, was the fruit of independent investigation, diversified
reading, and genuine industry. The most valuable part of its
contents was the new and enlarged knowledge of the cod. Venetus
provided by his discovery of Gronouius' collation in the margin of
a book of Bentley's. There is one passage, 681 sq„ which Mr Garrod,
though not the first to understand it, was the first to explain,
because the interpreters had not understood it ; but I do not think
that any other of his interpretations is both new and true. His
conjectures were singularly cheap and shallow, and his impatience
of more circumspect emendators, such as Bentley, broke out at 689
in insolence. The apparatus criticus is neither skilful nor careful,
often defective and sometimes visibly so; I have counted more
than 60 positive misstatements, of which only a minority can be
laid at Breiter's door. The translation is dexterous and serviceable‚
but has an average of more than three false renderings to the page,
not counting the suppression of inconvenient words and the insertion
of convenient ones. Some of his interpretations were so little
pondered that he changed them in the course of his work without
perceiving it ε there are more than a dozen places where translation
and commentary contradict one another, and at 409 discrepancy
is not confined to them. An astrological figure on p. 146,
borrowed from others, is false in four particulars to the editor's own
text. The commentary, which is full and mainly original, contains
