vi Μ. MAN ILII

as a representative of α is acknowledged by G and Ven. themselves,
for they much oftener side with L against one another than they
side with one another against L; but it is sometimes further con-
firmed by the adherence, entire or partial, of M, representing a’s
brother β. For example: 11 958 consummat LM, consumat G Ven.,
111 635 status M, satus L, situs G, satis Ven., 1v 23 an] ad LM, aut G,
id Ven., 453 tu L, tri M, tum G, tunc Ven., 489 septima fertur M,
sexta fertur L, sexta feretur G, serta refertur Ven., 524 dote M, docte L,
nocte G Ven., 525 oum profert unda M, profert cum unda L, profert
cum uincla G, profert quando unda Ven., 580 babiloniacas sum mersa
profuyit M, babilonia casum mersa profuyit L, babilonios casus profuyz't
G, babilonia casum mutauit Ven., 677 orbes LM, urbes G, orbem
Ven., v 57 decuma lateris] deus malateris L, deus mala terris M,
summa lateris G, om. Ven., 137 inyemta est] iraeyem'est M, ingentem L,
inqenium G, inqentem Ven., 487 rorantis] rotantis LM, portantis G,
potantis Ven. Beside these places, where the reading of α, preserved
by L, was true or close to the truth, there are others where it was
false or inferior, but where it is equally possible to see, or reasonable
to suspect, that L has preserved it, and that any true or superior
reading presented by G or Ven. is derived either from conjecture or
from some source other than α. Such are 11 259 pede G, per de LM,
pes Ven., 449 per Ven., fer L, fers M, fert G, 1v 223 perayqrant Ven.,
perararit LM, pererrant G, v 41 rector G, pector M, pectus L, uectus Ven.,
392 senibus GM, sensibus L, sensus Ven., 403 merces est parua GM,
parua merces est L, parua mercede Ven., 407 mutat GM, mittat L,
mittit Ven., 525 imperat GM, imperit L, imperio Ven.

Before Ι proceed to G I must interpose a narrative.

In 1903 G was the sovereign MS. Bentley had called it so 3 and
although he did not treat it as such, but made more use of V in
restoring the text, his words outweighed his actions, as words
generally do, and as they did again when he preached one thing and
practised another in his dealings with the Blandinianus uetustissimus
of Horace. Jacob in 1846 pronounced it interpolated, degraded it
to the third place, and exalted V to the first ; but he gave no reasoned
and ordered proof of his assertion, and succeeding critics * one after
another, from Breiter in 1854 to Bechert in 1900, condemned his
judgment and upheld the primacy of G. Bechert's devotion ex-
ceeded all precedent, and M stood low in his esteem : ‘ codicibus ita
usus sum, ut a G libro in textu constituendo proficiscendum ratus
huius codicis memoriam in textum reciperem, reliquorum codicum
testimonia non nisi speciosiora proferens. ubi autem G lectio

* Ellis in 1891, though placing G first, allowed much weight to V ; and in
1893 both he and Breiter reoognised, though not suffieiently, the value of M.
