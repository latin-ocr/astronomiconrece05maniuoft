108 M. MANILII ASTRONOMICON V

said Voltaire ‘ n'est un vice que quand il fait du mal; c'est une
tres-grande vertu quand il fait du bien ’ ; and my detractors were
01 his opinion. I enjoy the unfair advantage 01 being able to say
disagreeable things about them without any departure from the
truth.

Many examples 01 this peculiar and little noticed sort 01 corrup-
tion, the transposition 01 letters, were collected in 1842 by Unger,
electa critica pp. 3-5‚ and a few in 1881 by Vahlen, opusc. 1 pp. 141 sq.
I myself in these 27 years have noted more than 130 in my margins
here out 01 a much greater number, but I will now cite only some of
the most remarkable: Claud. 31 124 pudico, cupido, qu. VI 337
psaltria, splatria, Luc. Ι 532 lampas, palmas, Calp. buc. 11 82
castaneas, canasteas, Ouid. hal. 30 iter inuenit, interuienit, anth.
Lat. Ries. 440 2 patris, turpis, 567 4 adliyat, algidat, Vell. 11 33 4
infacete, infectae, Mart. VI 92 2 serpens, semper, VIII 26 3 germanice
times, germani crescet, X 56 6 nozarum, samonum, Val. Fl. V 586
segnior, qeniton Cic. pro Cael. 44 lustrorum, stuprorum, in Cat. 11 20
utrosque, quirites. To the examples from Manilius these additions
may be made : 1 805 alia aduerso] alio aduersa M, 11 231 ambiyuus]
ambuyius L, 111 149 in omnis] nominis M, 1v 224 uiolenta] uolentia M,

GLM, 929 locata] colata M, v 62 ayz'lem] aliyem G. Subtract v 425,
where ‘ dicutet ’ is a false report 01 Ellis's and van Wageningen's.

p. lx l. 21. Add amor. 1 8 80 ‘ uanescet culpa culpa repensa
tua ³, rem. 696 ‘ ut melior causa causa sit illa tua ⁹, fast. VI 440

‘ mixtaque erat flammae flamma profana piae ’.

p. lxv 1. 27. Add Cic. Phil. ΙΙΙ 32 lateribus, alteribus, Tac. Agr.
35 4 latera, altera.

p. lxviii l. 26. The co⁹rupto 01 Lucilius in ore corupto G.L.K.
v p. 400 8 is now interpreted by Mr Heraeus Rh. Mus. 1915 p. 41
as κορύπτω,

p. lxix ll. 4-23. As I now have photographs 01 the MSS Ι can
report precisely their spelling 01 the poet's name. M has M. Manili
after book 1, M. M anlii (or M anllz‘) Boez'z‘i (or Boez'u) after 11 (Loewe's
collation in Goett. cod. ms. philol. 139 reproduces the ductus
litterarum with great care), M. Milm‘li after ΙΙΙ. At the beginning
01 the poem it had no title. It has lost there only a single leaf, the
first of its first senio (Thielscher Philol. 1907 p. 88), and on that leaf
there was no room for a title, since it was filled by the 80 verses
which it contained : the next leaf, which contains the title de orzyine
mundi, contains for that reason only 79 verses. The different titles
