xxxvi M. MAN ILII

poems had perished and the verse survived only in the review, who
would have believed me rather than the compositor ’ἔ The bulk of
the reading public would have been perfectly content with rustli‘ny,
nay they would sincerely have preferred it to the epithet which the
poet chose. If I had been so ill-advised as to publish my emendation,
I should have been told that rustliny was exquisitely apt and
poetical, because hedgerows do rustle, especially in autumn, when
the leaves are dry, and when straws and ears from the passing
harvest-wain (to which ‘ harvest ' is so plain an allusion that only
a pedant like me could miss it) are hanging caught in the twigs ; and
I should have been recommended to quit my dusty (or musty) books
and make a belated acquaintance with the sights and sounds of the
English countryside. And the only possible answer would have been
uyh !

My first reception was not worse than I expected. I provoked
less enmity and insolence than Scaliger or Bentley in proportion as
my merits were less eminent and unbearable than theirs. But my
disregard of established opinions and my disrespect for contemporary
fashions in scholarship made the ignorant feel sure that I was
greatly and presumptuously in error and could be put down without
much difficulty ; and critiques were accordingly published which I
do not suppose that their authors would now wish to rescue from
oblivion. Not by paying any attention to any of them *, not by
swerving an inch from my original principles and practice, but by the
mere act of living on and continuing to be the same, I have changed
that state of things ; and the deas adder, though Ι can hardly say
that she has unstopped her own earS, has begun to stifle her hisses
for sear that they should reach the ears of posterity. Perhaps there
will be no long posterity for learning ; but the reader whose good

* Mr M. Schuster in Burs. Jahresb. vol. 212 p. 92 writes of my book 111 as
follows. ‘Mit Befriedigung nimmt man hier gegeniiber den beiden voraus-
gehenden Teilen ein gesteigertes Streben des Herausg.s wahr, dem iiberlieferten
Wortlaut nach besten Kraften Treue zu halten. Vollmer hatte in seiner
Besprechung der Ausgabe des ersten Buches dje allzugrosse Freigebigkeit
H.s mit Konjekturen bemangelt3 das verdross Herrn H. und ebenso unwillig
wie ungebiihrlich sprach er von einen “ stolid conservatism ’' Vollmers : indes
hat er doch nachtraglich, wie es scheint, aus seines Riigers Mahnung die
gebiihrende heilsame Lehre gezogen, so dass die Kritik in diesem Falle die
besten Friichte trrrg, die sie uberhaupt bringen kann.’ Dulce et decorum est
pro patria mentiri. ‘ Stolid conservatism ’ is a phrase which Ι have never
used in my lise. The hard things which Ι did say of Vollmer were said not
after his review, on which I made no comment, but before it ; they were said
in the work which he reviewed. And, far from employing conjecture with
less freedom in the later books, I employed it with more, because they are
more corrupt.
