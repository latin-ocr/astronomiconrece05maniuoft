M. MANILII ASTRONOMICON V 101

tuos L²G Ven., uastat uos L. But evidence that L2 had access to α
is very slight and scanty : 11 399, Ven. being absent, is not a certain
example, since the error manent may have arisen in α and not in L.

p. vii ll. 22 sqq. Add that M (for V can now be discarded) does
not contain 1 669 subsequiturque suo solem uaga Delia curru, 813—4
natalis euntes Ι protinus et rapti, 11 523 sq. trigona Ι siqua ueyam
Okelis foedus totique, 542 yemiui pisces quos pertulit unda.

p. viii l. 11 and p. lxix l. 11. Poggio’s letter, according to Mr
Garrod Class. Quart. 1909 p. 58, has not astronomicum but Astromicon.
The title in M before book ΙΙ is M. M anili astroumz'cou.

p. viii l. 13. ⁶ diuinare oportet, non legere ', as explained by
Mr Stangl in Berl. Phil. Woch. 1913 pp. 1180—4, is a parenthesis and
a precept, not a description of M’s text.

p. viii 11. 14 sq. ‘ Housman: “ est Matrit. liber transcriptio
facta per hominem doctum '' ’ Breiter vol. 1 p. vi. Ι suppose that
English was one of the many things which he did not understand.

p. viii 11. 19-21. In 1907 I examined Loewe’s collation in cod.
MS philol. 139 of the Goettingen library, and before the publication
of my second volume I obtained photographs of M.

p. viii 11. 22-8. In 1907 I procured photographs of V, and in the
Classical Quarterly of that year, pp. 290—5, Ι showed that the
opinion hazarded by Breiter in the Neue J ahrbuecher vol. 147 p. 421
(not 420) ,and ed. vol. Ι pp. vi sq. that V owes all it has of good to M,
though hastily formed and not seriously held (for he continued to
believe Ellis's statement, irreconcilable with that opinion, that M
gave possidet for condidit at 1v 776), was nevertheless true, and that
the obstacles which had deterred me from acceding to it were only
misreports of M by Ellis.

p. viii l. 29. The agreement of V with M begins between 11 661
(retinet V cod. Cusanus‚ retinent M) and 665 (habet Cus., 7ΐῑ Μ, om. V ;
nec pingitur Cus., ue ciuyitur M, uec iuuyitur V) or 668 (quadrato . . .
templo Cus., quadrata . . . templa MV). Be it observed that Breiter’s
674 is the same verse as my 684, quae quamquam eto„ since he
adopted the transposition and numeration of Jacob.

p. viii 1. 32. For 420 read 421. Mr Garrod in the Classical
Quarterly 1909 p. 59 said of V that ‘ down to 11 683 it follows the
Belgian (GL) recension-—as was pointed out by Ellis when he first
called attention to M. (Housman assigns the merit of this important
observation to Breiter) '. This is one of the flatteries with which
Mr Garrod escorted his venerable neighbour to the grave, and not a
word of it is true. Ellis did not make ‘ this important observation '
