xlii M. MANILII

to ‘ sequentes partes sphaerae barbaricae ’ and sets forth in 19-30
the effects of all the 360 degrees of the zodiac when found in the
horoscope, with the addition here and there of a few παρανατὲλλοντα,
some of them the same as those already mentioned in 6-17 ; and
in c. 31 he enumerates what he calls the ‘ clarae stellae ' of the
zodiac, with their effects when found in the horoscope, adding in the
next chapter that this also is the doctrine of the sphaera barbarica.
He therefore does not use the term as equivalent to the contents
of Man. v, but in a wider acceptation; and Man. v must not be
called sphaera barbarica because Firmicus accounts its doctrine
one portion of what he designates by that name.

Nor must it be called sphaera barbarica because it is concerned
with παρανατὲλλοντα. Boll sph. pp. 353-6 contends that the sphaera
barbarica of Nigidius was also concerned with these. It probably
was, for his sphaera Graecanica certainly was '¹‘ 3 but Boll’s method
of proving his point is to ignore the plain sense of Nigidius’ words
‘ sub Virginis signo ' and their exact agreement with the relief at
Denderah, and to pretend that Nigidius means something which he
does not say and the monument something which it does not show.
Be that as it may, concern with the doctrine of the παρανα τέλλοντα can
form no part of the definition of the term sphaera barbarica, since
Nigidius' sphaera Graecanica likewise contained that doctrine ; and
the sphaera Graecanica, or heaven of Greek constellations, which is
the background of Man. V does not become barbarica because the
παρανατὲλλοντα are the chief theme Of the book. The σφαῖρα βαρ-

βαρική of Asclepiades (containing Greek and barbaric constellations
mixed) was not concerned with παρανατὲλλοντα but with τὰ τῇ
σελήνῃ παραβάλλοντα, C.C.A.G. V i p. 188 11-23.

Though the sense which Firmicus attached to sphaera barbarica
was far removed from the proper and original sense, it may yet be
possible to explain the error or to trace the change. From Procl.
in Plat. remp. ed. Kr. vol. 11 p. 318 11 sqq. ἐνετύχομεν σφαίραισ βαρ-
βαρικαῖσ Αἰγυπτίων καὶ Χαλδαίων κατὰ τὰσ μοίρασ· τοῦ ζῳδιακοῦ τὰσ
τῶν βίων διαφορὰσ ὀριζούσαισ it would appear that the astrologers who
taught the doctrine set forth in Firm. VIII 19-30 made use of a
celestial globe with barbaric and not Greek constellations : Firmicus
then may have thought sphaera barbarica a good enough name for
this doctrine, and may have stretched it to include the doctrine of
Man. V, which he sets forth in 6-17, because in that doctrine also
the degrees of the zodiac have a part to play. And indeed the lists
of παρανατέλλοντα from Greek astrologers published by Boll sph.
