ASTRONOMICON V xxxiii

543-7 28. These improvements, because such they are, and because
the change is small and not confusing, I have adopted ; and I have
proceeded to others ’¹‘ in the same direction at 1 805-812 and 111
468-474. Breiter in 1907 reverted to Jacob’s numeration ; van
Wageningen wavers between Breiter and Bechert.

The apparatus criticus is embedded in the commentary and the
two are closely interwoven ; and that is as it should be. The usual
separation of inseparable things, interpretation and criticism, is
injurious to both but especially to the latter. It is the expedient
of editors who wish to shirk discussion of their text because they fear
that they could not defend it. Criticism apart from interpretation
does not exist ; and ‘ critical edition ' is the most inappropriate of
all names for the thing to which custom applies it, an edition in
which the editor is allowed to fling his opinions in the reader's face
without being called to account and asked for his reasons.

Most of the errors of an author’s MSS have no place in what
Cobet calls an ‘ apparatus uere criticus ⁷, and mine excludes them.
Variations of orthography are collected in an appendix. An
evidently false reading given by a single MS, where the rest are
agreed upon an evidently true one, Ι seldom record unless the
difference is in some way noteworthy3 but since M is the sole
survivor of one family, and L in places may be the only true witness
to the archetype of the other, I mention their peculial· errors oftener
than those of G or L2. A false reading found in two authorities, as
many are found in GL or GL2 or LM, Ι always register unless the error
is insignificantly small. From the Venetus I cite only true readings,
readings which support another MS where MSS disagree, and readings
conspicuously divergent and indicative of its character. Readings
of the Cusanus and the later MSS I mention only as I mention the
conjectures of editors; except that where M is not clearly legible
Ι sometimes adduce the decipherments of its apographs.

‘ Operam maximam eamque satis fastidiosam posui in primo
emendationis cuiusque auctore inuestigando '. I am one of the
few who can echo these words of Lachmann's: most editors have
souls above such things, and some of them so much prefer error to
knowledge that even when we patient drudges have ascertained the
facts for them they continue to disseminate misinformation. There
is another set of facts which I am almost alone in commemorating,
for it is desired to suppress them. Many a reading discovered by
conjecture has afterwards been confirmed by the authority of MSS ;
and Ι record the occurrence, as instructive, instead of concealing it,

* At 1 314—316, because Ι was not sure of the order of verses in M, 1 numbered
them according to their order in GL, which I now regret.
