ASTRONOMICON V xli

Viryim's siquo arator, quem Horon Aeyyptiz' uocant, quod H oron
Osiridis fllium ab hoc educatum dicunt? Nigidius said that under
(south of) * the zodiacal sign Virgo there was a constellation having
the figure of a ploughman and the name of Horos. On the celestial
globe of the Greeks this constellation did not exist ; but the figure
of a ploughman stands in this place, under (south of) Virgo, on a
relies in the temple of Hathor at Denderah (Boll sph. tas. 111). It
was a constellation on the celestial globe of the Egyptians. sphaera
barbarica means a plan of the heavens, especially an Egyptian 01·
Chaldaean plan, which groups the stars into constellations other
than the Greek.† This appears from the examples of the term
collected by Boll sph. pp. 350—66, whence I take the following.

Graeci duas ursas uocant, Helicen et Cynosuram, in barbarica sphaera
plaustrum esse, quod ducatur a bubus iunctis '.‡ A work with the
title σφαῖρα βαρβαρική by Asclepiades Myrleanus is mentioned in
0.0.A.G. v i p. 188 22 sq. z of its nature I will speak below.
Scaliger applied the name to this book of Manilius because of
what he found in Firmjcus. The twelve chapters Firm. math.
V111 6-17 are derived from Man. V, and Firmicus concludes them by
saying ‘ haec sunt . . . barbaricae sphaerae principia, haec est
Chaldaioi operis disciplina ’. But in the next chapter 18 110 proceeds

Fluuium Cetus in caeli reqione collocatus est, Germ. phaen. 87, 343, 433.

†Scaliger Man. v praef„ Buecheler opusc. 1 pp. 108 sqq.‚ and Swoboda
quaest. Nigid. p. 48 were perversely wrong about the meaning of the term:
Salmasius ann. clim. pp. 592 sq. was nearly right, for he said that Nigidius
in his sphaera barbarica ‘ opinionem Aegyptiorum sacerdotum perscripsit, qui
alias causas commenti sunt τῆιτ καταστερίσεωσ corporum eorum caelestium
aliasque illorum appellationes habuerunt ’3 but 110 did not understand that
the constellations themselves were in many cases different, not having the same

forms and boundaries as the Greek constellations, nor consisting of the same
stars.

ζ In this sentence there are two obvious blunders, but it is still apposite.
