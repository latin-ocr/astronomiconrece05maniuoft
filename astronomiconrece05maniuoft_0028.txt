contents of 539-560. But between 560 and 561 M has cle circulis
caelestibus: de coluris. The former title is right; it states the
contents of 561—804. The latter, de coluris, is wrong; the right
place for it would be before 603 sunt duo, and it states the contents
of 603—630. But the verses between 563 and 567 had been lost,
and the transposition of leaves had carried away 568-611, so that
612-630, describing the colures, followed on 563 (with only the
intervention of 567, which this corrector was removing), and the
colures were therefore the first circles occurring after 561. The
corrector accordingly wrote de coluris before that verse, beside the
older title de circulis caelestibus. In β both were reproduced; but
α took cle coluris to be a correction of de circulis caelestibus, and so L
gives cle coluris only. (In G there is no title and no space for it;
de coluris is added by a later hand in the margin.)

Between 529 and 566 L and M have the title de parallelis circulis,
and G has it in the margin, apparently from the first hand. It has
no business to follow 529, but it is appropriate to 566-602, and was
probably added by the corrector together with his own verse 566
when he inserted 567 at this place.

The transpositions in book 1 are thus seen to have been earlier
than the archetype. Another, the great transposition of 111 400-Iv 9
and IV 10—313, is later, and found only in Mss of the family α. The
verses 1v 10—313 are 304 in number, that is 38 >< 8 ; and 111 400-1v 9,
together with the 9 titles, occupying 10 lines, which existed in this
portion of the archetype, are nearly the same, 302. It looks therefore
as if a quaternio '¹‘ of 38 lines to the page had here been folded inside
out, so that its last half came first, as I suggested in my note at
ΠΙ 399. This suspicion I can now confirm. In L, our best repre-
sentative of α, the number of lines in the preceding part of the
poem, 1 1—111 399, verses and titles and spaces for titles together, is
2364 ; and its text, as was pointed out by Bechert de Man. em. rat.
p. 10 11. 9, begins on the 2⁸d leaf of its lSt quaterniO, the lSt leaf,
now lost, having contained no verses. If α resembled it in these
features, and had 38 lines to the page, the number of lines preceding
111 400 was about 2440 (2364 -4- 76) ; and 608 >< 4 (4 quaternios) is 2432.
It becomes pretty clear that 111 400-1v 313 were the contents of the
5²¹² quaternio of α.

But Bechert p. 23 and ΜΓ Thielscher Philol. LXVI pp. 131 sq.
refer this transposition, though only one family is affected by it,
to their imaginary archetype. For Bechert the interchanged

* Mr Garrod p. xix saw that the transposition must have been later than the
archetype, and found the number 38 ; but beside overlooking the titles he
went astray in his arithmetio and operated with ternios.
