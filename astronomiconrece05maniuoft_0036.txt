xxx M. MANILII

facite hic lege potius liceat quam ui uicto uiuere ' ι he sees there the same two
words side by side, and how should he know that uicto is not abl. neut. with
uiuere but dat. masc. with liceat? 1v 683 ‘ iynis pro puella amata etiam
apud . . . Hor. . . . Sat. 11 3 276 ⁷: that is iqnem qladio scrutare, which he
evidently connects with Hellade percussa in the next verse. IV 909 ‘ et post nec
habet uim aduersatiuam ’ : this Ι had pointed out, citing a paralle13 but van
Wageningen proceeds ‘cf. Ou. Met. XIV 842 ’, a passage where nec. . . et
correspond like nec . . . nec or et . . . et.

Such a scholar cannot hope to understand the language or follow the
thought of a Latin author. If a schoolboy were shown the words tantae molis
minimum deprendere punctum, even without their context, he would probably
translate them right3 but van Wageningen's note on 111 215 is ‘ tantae moli-9
sc. est, cf. Verg. Aen. 1 33 ’. If a schoolboy were shown the words animis
haerentia pectora, especially in their context at 11 676, he might well wonder
what they could possibly mean ; but he would not think, as van Wageningen
did, that they could possibly mean ‘ pectora quae facile se cum aliis iungunt ’.
If he were shown the verses 11 849-51, he would not indeed understand them,
but he would have the wit, which van Wageningen had not, to construe the
exercita of 851 with the tempora of 850 and not with the pars of 849. In an
enumeration of the four elements, 1 249 aeris atque iqnis, terrae pelaqique
iacentis, who else, even if he had not read 536 pontum terrasque iacente& would
think that iacentis meant quiescentis ’ἰ Who else, even if he had not read 1 297
septem . . . stellae certantes lamine, would miss the sense of v 141 sq. certantes
luce . . . Pleiadas and explain ‘omnes conantes simul reddere lumen ' ? But
van Wageningen could miss the sense of anything. At 11 603 sq. Manilius, having
filled some 50 verses with the various and complicated enmities subsisting
between the several signs of the zodiao, and consequently between the men
born beneath them, makes the remark in multis quoniam discordia siqnie Ι cor-
pora nascuntur, pax est sublata per orbem. Van Wageningen interprets ‘ cum
multitudo signorum magna sit ’—there are only 12—‘ h.e. cum tanta sit copia
horoscoporum ’. At 111 265 ibi m‘eans ‘ in octaua parte Cancri ’ : he explains
it as ⁵ ab initio Cancri ad Capricornum ⁵, which not only is manifestly impossible
but makes outrageous nonsense. 1v 836 fuyeruntque nouas ardentia sidera
flammae: ‘ardentia sidera, cf. Ou. Met. 11 171-177; Man. 1 748’: in vain
did Manilius think out his pretty conceits, and in vain do Ι explain them. At
11 805 he joins uincula bina, which Bentley had put asunder, and as this is
arithmetically false he says ‘ bis (proprie quater) ’. At IV 46 (Marius) consul
totiens (i.e. sexies) exul . . . adiacuit Libycis . . . ruinis he writes ⁶ consul totiens
sc. septies . . . sed sexies consul fuerat, cum exul in Africam fugit ’. IV 711—4,
because different lands belong to different signs, idcirce, says Manilius, in uaria-9
Zeqes uariasque fiqurasl dispositum qenus est hominum, proprioque colore Ι
formantur qentes sociataque iura per artus Ι materiamque parem priuato foedere
siqnant, i.e. sociata per artus iura paremque materiam signant priuato foedere,
the human form common to all is varied by national peculiarities. Van
Wageningen construes and interprets thus: ⁴ sociata iura . . . priuato foedere
siqnant, societatem ineunt, quam foedere sanciunt, ut priuati in pace inter se
uiuant—per artus materiamque parem (adiectiuum parem ad utrumque sub-
stantiuum pertinet) : propter similitudinem corporis atque indolis ’. On the
other hand he can construe what others cannot. At Ι 455 the antarctic sky
is cardine tam simili sultam quam uertice, which puzzles us much, because
cardo and uertex are synonyms. But van Wagem'ngen comes to our rescue τ
