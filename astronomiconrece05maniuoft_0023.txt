ASTRONOMICON V xvii

extracted by Mr Thielscher Rhein. Mus. 1907 pp. 50 sq.; to which
may be added a lost MS called δ by Bentley in his marginalia and
known to him from a collation in a Bodleian copy (identified by Mr
Garrod as auct. O. 5. 17) of the ed. Bononiensis* The remainder
(again so far as known) are also of this strain in the staple of their
text, but more or less improved by an admixture of the tradition
of M. Among these the Florentine Laur. XXX 15 and the Oxonian
Bodl. auct. F. 4. 34 are rich repertories of the emendations made by
Italian scholars.†

Those emendations, as usual, are very numerous, and often
brilliant though of course often obvious; and the editors before
Scaliger, excepting Regiomontanus,‡ made no large addition to
them: Scaliger himself and Bentley are the great augmenters of
the sum.§ I have made a fairly diligent count of the corrections
adopted in my text or approved in my commentary, arranging
them in chronological order because emendation grows ever more
difficult and success therefore more meritorious; and here it is.

* Bentley once by a slip of the pen calls it ‘ δ Pithoei ’‚ and hence springs
the confusion on p. xiv of his nephew's preface which is noted by Mr Garrod
p. xliii.

† Ι grudge space to matter so immaterial, but Mr Thielscher's list in Philol.
1907 pp. 126—9 can be supplemented and Mr Garrod's classification on pp.
lv-lvii corrected by two pieces of precise information.

The cod. Caesenas an. 1457 (bibl. Malatest. 113· Fila, xxvo Pluteo, VO in
ordine), of which Ellis sent word to Mr Thielscher‚ has one of these blended
texts and is akin to the Bodleianus and to the MS next to be mentioned. I spent
a couple of hours looking it through and collated the first hundred lines or so.

The α of Bentley's margin is described by him as ‘ cod. P. Pithoei Luyerii
ad oram ed. Scalig. 1600 ’, which book Mr Garrod p. xliv identifies as Linc. D.
5. 13 in the Bodleian library. The MS there collated is probably now extant
as G. 38. 46 in the public library of Boston in Massachusetts (Philological
Quarterly 1 p. 105). It was written at Ferrara in 1461 by Peregrinus Allius,
once belonged to Pithoeus, and was sold among the Barrois MSS of the Earl of
Ashburnham in June 1901. It is akin, as Ι have said, to the Caesenas, and
in both of them Manilius is followed by Q. Serenus.

ss Regiomontanus has so many corrections which have not been found in
any Ms that they must apparently be his own. Corrections which he shares
with a MS should be assigned rather to it than to him unless its date is ascer-
tained as later ; for if the scribes had borrowed anything from him they must
have borrowed more.

§It is to be remembered, not in derogation of their merits, that Scaliger,
as the first editor to use Gr, and Bentley, as the first to use V, found virgin soil.
Breiter and Ellis found virgin soil again when M was discovered, but bequeathed
it not much impoverished to me.
