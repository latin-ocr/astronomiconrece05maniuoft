154 M. MANILII ASTRONOMICON V

p. x uu. 408-501. Van Wageningen observes at 481 sq. ‘ si te
fata sinant, quartam ne selige partem Ι Centauri ; fuge et octauam '
that we selz'gse and fuye, which cannot be advice to the unborn on
the choice of a nativity, must apparently have reference to the
καταρχαί of which I spoke at 111 154, the lucky or unlucky moments
for initiating a course of action, which provided Maximus with the
subject and the title of his poem. The same remark will apply to
441 sq. ‘ nec parua est gratia nostri Ι 0115, 51 tantum poterit signare
cauenda '. But on the other hand we find 428 sq. ⁶ quodque per has
geritur partes sine fruge creatur Ι aut cadit aut multis sentit bona
mixta querellis ⁵, where yerz'tar indeed and cadit are ambiguous, but
creatur and sentit bona can only refer to the birth of living creatures.
Nativities moreover are the poet's theme both in what precedes this
account of the partes damnandae and in what follows it : in 122—293
(the twelve signs), in 294—386 (the deeans, see 370-7 creatur, nascitur,
fetus, partus), and in 502—84 (certain degrees of the signs at the
moment of their rising, see 507 yenerabz't etc.); and the partes
damnandae are so linked to the decans by verses 409-15 and to the
rising degrees by verses 5024 that they must necessarily themselves
also pertain to nativities. It appears therefore that Manilius has
let his attention wander. Absorbed in his arithmetic, which he
loved much better than astrology, he forgets at 481 sq. what he
ought to be talking about, and slips into phrases like Verg. georg.
1 277 quintam fuge, which are appropriate only to καταρχαί. Τ1115
excuse cannot be pleaded for the cauenda of 442; but there the
inconsistency is less salient, and cauenda is no more than an
incautious variation of dawmanda.

It was characteristic of van Wageningen that in making the just
remark which Ι have cited from his p. 232 he should forget what he
had said of these partes damnandae on p. 229, where 116 tried to
connect them With the μοῖραι σινωτικαί or σινωτικαὶ ὀφθαλμῶν
of certain late Greek astrologerS, such as one of A.D. 379 from whom
we have a chapter περὶ σιιόποιῶν μοιρῶν ἤτοι τόπων τῶν σινουμὲνων
τὰσ (impera in C.C.A.G. v i pp. 208 sq. These are places in the zodiac
said to contain nebulous clusters, νεφελοειδεῖσ συστροφάσ ; and men
in whose genitures any one of these degrees plays an important part,
οἱ οὕτω γεννώμενοι, suffer injury, mostly to the eyes, when the
Moon or Sun under certain conditions is found in that degree. What
professes to be a full list of the σινωτικαὶ μοῖραι 15 given by Antiochus
in C.O.A.G. vn pp. 111 sq.: apart from repetitions they are 34
in number, and only 8 or at most 9 of them are among Manilius'
partes dcmmandac. In VHI iv p. 187 Rhetorius enumerates 27,
most of which are included in the longer catalogue ; and ibid.
