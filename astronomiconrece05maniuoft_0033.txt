instead of what 3 most will guess wrong, and again at 684 quoqueret.
He had not even learnt to read an apparatus criticus: he shows
ignorance of the lections of the cod. Flor. in dozens of places where
Bechert’s silence had made them known to every instructed student.
The text is neither conservative nor intelligently amended3 con-
jectures are admitted without respect of merit, the last dregs of
Breiter and the topmost froth of Mr Garrod are gulped down
together, and the Mss are nowhere more readily deserted than where
their tradition is sound. Of his own conjectures, which are few,
I can accept only one. The index is almost as full of errors as the
apparatus criticus, and p. 187 reveals that in the verse qualis
Erectheos pestis populata colonos he supposed Erectheos to be a
genitive of the 3⁸¹ declension.

The Latin commentary was separately published in 1921 with
no small magnificence by the royal academy of sciences at Amster-
dam. What it most resembles is a magpie's nest. With the rarest
exceptions, all that it contains of any value‚ whether interpretation
or illustration, is taken from others, and usually without acknow-
ledgment. A reader new to the author and the editor might
mistake van Wageningen for a man of learning; but with my
knowledge of both I can trace every stolen penny to the pouch
it came from. On p. 41 the note of seventeen lines upon verses
149—166 may seem to indicate a considerable amount of reading,
and so it does, for it is from Ed. Mueller de Pos. Man. auct. p. 2.
On pp. 43 sq. thirty-three consecutive lines, equally impressive,
are a mosaic put together from pp. 3 and 4 and 7 of the same treatise
and from F. Malchin de auct. quib. qui Pos. libr. met. adhib. pp. 15 sq·
P. 178 consists of thirty-seven lines : seventeen of them are mine.
From those of his predecessors who wrote in Latin he copies many
whole sentences word for word, especially from Fayus and me*
I am his chief resource in books 1 and ΙΙΙ ; my fourth volume appeared
when his compilation was nearing completion and is therefore
plundered less 3 in book 11 his wants were so abundantly supplied
by the ampler and more elementary commentary of Mr Garrod that
he left mine unread, only dipping into it here and there.

The true character of his activities peeps out amusingly in trifles. At
11 175-7 ὀρῶν for ὡρῶν is a misprint of Bouchei-Leclercq's, at 468 haerent for
haerens is a misprint of Mr Garrod’s, at v 605 ‘ Col. ΧΠ 48 2 ’ is a false reference

* Where he professes to be quoting he is less faithful, and at 1 313, in four
lines attributed to me and enclosed within inverted commas, he has made six
alterations.
