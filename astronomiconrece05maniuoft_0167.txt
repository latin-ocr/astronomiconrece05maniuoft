LIBRO I ADDENDA 105

p. xi note. These reports I can now correct from photographs
as follows. 5 imitantis R. 11 propius UR. 44 secat corr. ex serat R.
53 siquam* R. (106 should be 108). 120 cauenda M. 141 ne M.
143 labilis corr. ex habilis M. πί librato corr. ex umbrato M. 201
mutata M. 217 adeiacas U.

p. xii ll. 16—9. See p. xvii of this volume.

pp. xii sq. Bonincontrius’ reading at ΙΙ 952, as I have said in my
note there, is not morti but Μ arti.

p. xiii ll. 4—8. Among editions having a character of their own
should be mentioned a quarto ‘ sine loco et anno ⁵, 5692 in R.
Proctor’s index of early printed books at the British Museum,
assigned to Β. de Vitalibus at Venice and to a date about 1500.

p. xiii l. 39. For timidi read tumidi.

p. xv ll. 12 sq. Read ‘ Plinianae exercitationes ³.

p. xv l. 19. The date of Sherburne's translation is 1675.

Ρ. xv l. 23. Creech’s first edition appeared in 1697.

p. xv ll. 28-32. See p. xviii of this volume.

p. xvii l. 32. V, as I have already said, begins as early as 11 668
or 665.

p. xviii l. 24. Scaliger also in his first edition gave mensibus
at 111 547.

p. xix ll. 12 sqq. A few apt parallels, the only good thing in
Stoeber’s edition, probably come from the ‘ uberrimam locorum
parallelorum copiam ' in the remains of J. Vierschrot which he
mentions on p. 9 of his preface.

p. xix note. I now think that this statement of J acob's on p. xiv
of his edition is simply false ; for in progr. Lubec. 1835 p. 17 n. he
said that the copy of Scaliger’s 21¹d ed. containing the collation of V
made for Bentley was not the same as the copy containing Withof’s
conjectures.

p. xxii ll. 27 sqq. I did not praise Bechert’s accuracy, because
accuracy is a duty and not a virtue ; but if I could have foreseen the
shameful carelessness os Breiter and van Wageningen I should

70 are blank, 71-145 contain Manilius, 146 is blank. Astro Ι nomicon in the
title of book 1 is divided so. The blunder M ilnili is not found in U and R.
At 1 350 the reading of H is andromeda ; the reading orta at 1v 17 is not absent
from GLM. 1v 666 and 667 are not transposed. v 363 sq. (=362 sq.) are
placed after 374 (=373) not only by H but by all MSS. H does not omit
‘ 1 809—810 (Breiter) '. Its omissione of 1 813 natalibus . . . 814 rapti and of
111 370 are not peculiar to itself but shared with UR and derived from M.
extrudere in 1 423 (not 431) and et dulcia in Π 22 are not conjectures of H but

of ΜΖ.
