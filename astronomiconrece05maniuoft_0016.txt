corrected by a hand somewhat resembling L2. But it had many
corrections which L2 has not, it lacked many which L2 exhibits, and
its corrections were often different from those of L2; and the
primitive substance of its text was derived not from L but from α.
For example in 1v 318 ⁶ extremam Eriqonae tribuit ' L has eriyonem,
G triyone. Neither is derived from the other ; they are equidistant
from the truth, and point to eriyone or amyone in the common source.

To determine in such cases the reading of α we can sometimes
employ the joint witness of M to the reading of the archetype. 1v 414 ε

Μ quaque minor ibi touit namque omnia mixtis
G quaque minor namque omnia mixtis
L quaque minoribus namque omnia mixtis.

α had ibi touit or something of the same length ; γ could not read it
and left the proper space; L read it wrong and reproduced it in-
exactly.*

111 432 munere] munero M, numero L, mmmm G. α, like M, had
munero, which in L and G is corrupted separately and differently.

1v 519 feminei incedunt nec] feminea iaceat nec M, feminea iace
(space of 3 letters) nec G, feminea iacet nec L. α had iaceat (as L2
corrects) or iaceant.

IV 894 mundus in ipsis L, mundus ipsis GM and almost certainly o, 3
for it is evidently much more probable that the unmetrical reading
was in the archetype and that L made the obvious correction, than
that in was twice omitted. ‘ Liesse sich etwa zeigen, dass M und G
in Korruptelen fibereinstimmen, die in L von erster Hand durch
Konjektur behoben sind, so ware ich ins Unrecht gesetzt' said
ΜΓ Thielscher Philol. LXXXII p. 173.

The many cases—far more than are registered in my apparatus
criticus or need to be registered in any—where GM agree in truth
and L is in error are not certain proof of G's separate derivation
from α; for it will appear hereafter that G has derived true
readings from β or some source other than α, and some os its true
readings are such as may be due to conjecture. But a valid argument
may be drawn from sundry agreements in orthography.

G’s orthography in general, compared with L’s‚ is modernised
and vulgarised. It tends to assimilate the preposition in compounds
where L does not, and to give -es in accusatives plural where L gives
43. It is natural to infer that in such places the spelling of α was
that of L and not of G ; and the inference becomes more than natural,
it becomes virtually certain, in the many places where M agrees

* L2 wrote ouit overhead, of which more anon.
