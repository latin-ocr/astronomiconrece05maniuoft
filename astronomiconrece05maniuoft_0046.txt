xl M. MANILII

For he, when he came to write his fifth book, no longer possessed
even so much astronomy as had sufficed him for writing his first;
and the celestial globe which he had then borrowed from a friend to
teach him how the constellations lay and save him from lifting his
eyes to heaven had long been restored to its owner. He makes the
Hyades rise 9 degrees in advance of the Pliades, when the Pliades
in any latitude must rise first. He makes the Haedi rise 10 degrees
in advance of Capella, when in reality their risings are necessarily
almost simultaneous. Only in five cases, Heniochus, Canicula,
Crater, Cycnus, CetuS, do his statements approximate to experience
or agree with the doctrine of any astronomer ; and in Argo, Orion,
Sagitta, Ara, Arcturus, Ophiuchus, Piscis Notius, Cepheus, Aquila,
Equus, Engonasin, he is extravagantly astray.

In five of these instances‚ Argo, Sagitta, Arcturus, Ophiuchus,
Engonasin, the extent of his error happens to be about a quarter of
the heavens, so that these constellations are really crossing the
meridian, either above or below the earth, when the portions of the
zodiac with which he connects them are rising. Hence it is inferred
by Boll sph. pp. 381 sq. that Manilius' authority had here used the
word παρανατὲλλειν in a loose sense, to include μεσουρανεῐν and
ἀντιμεσουρανεῖν and καταδύεσθαι ; and he ShOWS on pp. 86 sq. that
Teucer Babylonius makes some statements which are gravely
erroneous unless he is stretching the word to that wider signification.
When Boll attempts on pp. 88 and 364 sq. to establish this sense by
citing Procl. in Plat. remp. ed. Kr. vol. 11 pp. 56 sq.‚ he is guilty of
imprudence or effrontery, for Proclus carefully distinguishes,
διαφερόντωσ· μὲν ἐν ‘res π α ρ α ν α τ ἑ λ λ ε ι ν, πάντωσ δὲ καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν
ἄ λ λ ω ν κέντρων, οἷον ἐν τῴ συμμεσουρα νεῖν ἦ συγκαταδύεσθαι;
but in a passage which he adduces on p. 87 from an astrologer of
the 4²²¹ century after Christ, C.C.A.G. Ι p. 113 13, παρανατὶλλειν is
made equivalent to ἐπικεῖσθαι and comprises appearances in the μεσου-
ράνημα and ὃύο-ισ and ὑπόγειον. There is however no reason to
suppose that Manilius’ authority or authorities thus misused the word
παρανατὲλλειν, if they even used it : the assumption would explain
only five out of his many errors ; and there is only one of these five,
the case of Engonasin, in which his statement coincides with Teucer'S.

Scaliger in his second edition imposed on this book the title of
sphaera barbarica, which is doubly a misnomer. The book is no
sphaera or description of the heavens, and, if it were, it would be a
sphaera Graecanica, like the first book. sphaera Graecanica and
sphaera barbarica were the titles of two works by P. Nigidius Figulus,
and of the latter we have one fragment from which we can learn its

subject: Seru. georg. 1 19 ‘ Nigidius sphaerae barbaricae: sub
