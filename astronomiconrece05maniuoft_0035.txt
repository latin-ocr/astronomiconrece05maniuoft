ASTRONOMICON V xxix

the two mistakes z ‘ motus=m0d0s‚ modulationes, cf. Verg. G. 1 350, Hor. C.
m 6 21 ’. At 11 43 Mr Garrod, misled by its title, supposed Nicander's θηριακά
to be a book about hunting, and van Wageningen therefore expresses the same
opinion. At 111 13 he writes ‘ quos ex Iasone filios susceperat Medea, eos
membratim discerptos in illius conspectu ex alta turri deiecit ⁵ ι this is credu-
lously copied from Fayus, with three verbal alterations. At 111 296 he
volunteers the statement ‘ uerbum ὡροσκοπεΐν apud Sextum Empiricum ’—
whom, as I said before, he never read—-‘ significat horam partus obseruare, sed
uerbum Latinum aliam uim assumpsit ³. This gratuitous falsehood he took
from the lexicons : the truth is that Sextus uses ὡροσκοπεῖν just as Manilius
uses horoscopare, and so do the Greeks in general. At 1v 23l-3 he writes
⁵ subiunqere currus sc. equis, constructio inuersa pro uulgari: equos currui ',
‘ ad frena, praepositio modum et rationem indicatzhabem's flexibilibus ’,
‘ totiszomnibus ³ : Fayus made these three mistakes in these three verses, so
van Wageningen must make them anew.

His own original contributione offer little temptation to larceny, and he
might say with Iago ‘ who steals my purse, steals trash ’. He writes for readers
who crave such lore as ‘ Colchida : Medeam.—parentis : Aeetae ' or ‘ Chelarum
:Librae ' (at v 295, after the word has occurred a dozen times), or ‘ diuersa ’
Ι 248, ‘ reduces ' 111 12, ‘ mixta ’ 133, ‘ sinuantis in undam ’ IV 604, ‘ et εόῑᾶ uos '
757, ⁶ socia per mutua dote ‘ v 680. Well for them if all the information supplied
them were equally true; but they have an ignorant instructor. Ignorant of
fact: he thinks that the southern hemisphere of stars is invisible from the
north pole for half the year only (ΠΙ 378 ‘ effuqit: sc. pars inferior ’), that
nights are shortest when the sun is in Capricorn (ΠΙ 639 ⁶ tenebrasque resoluit
sc. in minimum horarum numerum '), and even apparently that midsummer
comes 365 times a year (ΓΠ 420 ‘ usque . . . indicat . . . id quod cotidie solet
fieri '). Ignorant of fable : v 92 ‘ hoc alibi non traditur, a Salmoneo pontes
aeneos factos esse, per quos quadrigam suam ueheret ’ : no editor of Manilius
had cited Seru. Aen. VI 585, so how was he to know of it? Prodigiously
ignorant of Latin. At 1 926 he explains non quaerat as ‘ desideret ’, i.e.
quaerat. At 111 296 he talks of an interrogative adverb quandoque. 111 527
nec in cunctos seruat fortuna tenorem, ⁶ erga cunctos fortuna se infidelem praebet ⁹.
1v 77 sq. deqenerant nati patribus uincuntque parentes Ι ingeniumque suum
retinent : ⁶ inqenium a patribus acceptum (suum) ’. 1v 138 sq. ⁶ in trepido . . .
pectore: quale in oue est ’ : the ouis is proverbially placida, but he thought that
trepidus meant timidus. 1v 168 annonae incendia, ‘ robiginem in frumento ’.
IV 655 ‘ radicis odores ε arbores odoriferas '. Ν 829 ⁶ natat : σαλεύεται ’.
v 577 ‘ concitat aerios cursus: cito cursum per aera conficit. Accusatiuus
uerbalis est ’. v 652 tenuis ausus . . . qressus (funambulus), ‘lente audens
procedere ’. His grammatica] obtuseness is perhaps best displayed by the
things which he takes for parallels. 1 908 ⁴ iurata. . . arma: bellum iure
iurando susceptum, cf. Cic. ad Att. 1 l 1 : iurauit morbum ’ ε he found this in
the dictionary, and did not know that it meant ‘ morbum iuratus excusauit'.
At 11 468 sq. auribus haerent Ι aut odium foedusue mrum, where aut and ue are
not coordinate, he quotes (from Kuehner's grammar) a passage of Cicero where
they are. 111 679 in auersum LM, in aduersum G : the sense should be ‘ in the
reverse direction ⁹, and Ι gave in auersum, pointing out that Ι 684 is different :
van Wageningen writes ‘ in aduersum (1 684) fere idem atque contra, cf. Verg-
Aen. 1x 211 si quis in aduersum rapiat casusne deusue '‚ where aduersum means
adversity. At 1v 182 uiuere uicto he says ‘ uicto pro rapto, cf. Plaut. Rud. 621 ε
