viii M. MANILII

recensione ' published by Mr Paul Thielscher in Philol. LXVI (1907)
pp. 106—125, where he undertook to support by theory what Vollmer
had recommended in practice. He contended that G was a copy
of L as corrected by L2. On p. xxv of my first volume I had tacitly
and incidentally refuted this theory before ever it was propounded ;
but it was nevertheless embraced in 1915 by van Wageningen in the
preface to his recension z in the preface only, for in his recension itself
he treated G throughout as an independent authority and sometimes
allowed it too much weight. To prove his contention Mr Thielscher
on pp. 123-5 selected 75 examples. They are simply examples
compatible—though one at least, 1v 414, is not compatible—with
his hypothesis ; and he might easily have cited 750 or 7500. Every
one of them is equally consonant with the true hypothesis, that G
and L are derived from a common source ; and most of them, being
cases of simple agreement, are equally consonant with a third
hypothesis, that L is derived from G. If L, as Mr Thielscher supposeS,
is older than G, and this hypothesis therefore impossible, that only
makes the futility of such argument more obvious. Tha-t L's
corrections are not all of them older than G he himself admits *;
some of them are in fact much later ; and one of these he has had
the ill luck to include among his proofs of G's derivation from L.
It is at 1 684, where L has positos with α added above, and G positas :
the superscript α 13 111 the hand of which I speak on p. 100, a hand
of the 13ἴῃ century or later ; so that if, as Mr Thielscher will have
it, one is derived from the other, G must be the source. This mischance
may perhaps bring home to him the truth, which should have been
self-eviclent, that simple agreement between two MSS is no proof
that either is derived from the other ; and most of his examples are
of this kind,—places where G and L2 have the same reading, as
111 2 saltos LM, saltus GL2, or where G and L have the same reading,
as 1 520 puncto L2M‚ ponto GL. Another such, IV 422 ponti L2M,
christi GL, is paraded by van Wageningen † p. vi, who calls it, heaven
knows why, ‘ ex omnibus grauissimum ' ; and Mr M. Schuster in
Bursian’s J ahresbericht vol. 212 p. 90 unreservedly agrees with him
and says ⁶ dieses eine Beispiel mag geniigen '. The argument is that

* About athanas 1v 659 he is of two minds: on p. 110 it ‘transiit in
Gemblacensem ³, on p. 116 it is ‘ Gemblacensi posterior '.

† Van Wageningen on the same page makes the false and calumnious
statement, repeated by Mr Bickel Rhein. Mus 1926 p. 333, that Traube, like
Mr Thielscher, held Gr to be an apograph of L. Traube was guilty of no such
impertinence : he knew that this was a question not for him but for scholam
conversant with Manilius. What he said, Philol. 1907 p. 122, was what a
palaeographer could say without immodesty : that 1, seemed to him, so far as
he could judge from photographs, rather older than G.
