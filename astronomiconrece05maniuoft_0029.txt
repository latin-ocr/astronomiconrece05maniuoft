ASTRONOMICON V xxiii

members (304 and 302 lines) are two sets 01 7 leaves (44 >< 7 =308) :
how sets 01 7 leaves could be interchanged he does not explain, nor
what has become 01 the superabundant verses. For Mr Thielscher,
whose archetype is wax in its creator's hands, these are two ternios
01 about 48 (48><6=288) ’¹‘ or 50 (50><6=300) lines to the leaf.
How it happens that β was unaffected by the transposition Bechert
did not enquire ; but this was a very serious question 101· Μ1 Τ11161-
scher, who is committed to the false assumption that L and M are
direct copies 01 the archetype. That false it is I have already
shown on p. ix; the glimpse which we have just caught 01 α is
another nail in its coffin3 and the shift to which it here reduces
Mr Thielscher ought to make even him distrust it. If M and not L
were the MS with the wrong order, he would have no trouble ; he
could say that the transposition took place between the Hm and
the 150¹ century. But now he is forced to suppose that the leaves
01 his endlessly subservient and obliging archetype, after having
been astray in the 11th century, were consecutive in the 15th.

From the Mss I now proceed to the efflorescence 01 editions
which has enriched the opening 01 the 20⁰¹ century.

In 1907, his 83rd year, Breiter published the first volume, text
with apparatus criticus, 01 the edition which he had been meditating
for a lifetime ; the second, a commentary, followed in 1908, a few
months before his death. Though slender in bulk and unpre-
tentious in character they were hailed by his countrymen as a
‘ gigantisches Lebenswerk' and a ‘ monumentum aere perennius

deutschen Gelehrtenfleisses ’; ‘ Durch ihren hohen wissenschaft-
lichen Wert tritt Br.’s Ausgabe den Arbeiten Scaligers, Bentleys
und ²—eloquent conjunction—‘ Pingres wurdig zur Seite ' ; ‘ Die

Wissenschaft ist um ein monumentales Hilfsmittel 1111 das Ver-
standnis dieses schweren Dichters bereichert, der Studierende hat
einen zuverlassigen Fuhrer gewonnen : immensus labor est et
fertilis idem! ' This ought not to be forgotten, and the reader
should bear it steadily in mind as he peruses what I am about to say.

Breiter's papers in Fleckeisen’s Neue J ahrbuecher, vol. 139 (1889)
and vol. 147 (1893), were the most estimable contribution made to
the study 01 Manilius after J acob's edition. The corrections 01 Ellis
were rather more numerous, and one or two 01 them were very
pretty, but his readers were in perpetual contact with the intellect
01 an idiot child : in Breiter's articles the good preponderated, and

* The explanation of this low figure is that he has overlooked the titles and
so reckons 111 400-1v 9 as 292 lines.
