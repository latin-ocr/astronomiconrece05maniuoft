LIBRO Ι ADDENDA 103

G Cus. ; but these mistakes or conjectures might easily be made in
two Mss independently, even the last, where decurrere stands im—
mediately overhead. That Cus. in 111 670 reads uertuntur with G
instead 01 flectuntur with L is not a fact but an error of Bechert's‚
who also errs at ΙΙΙ 605 and 669 ; that in v 392 it reads peplo with G
instead of populo with L is an error of Breiter'S.

Now if Cus. was directly copied from L, its many corruptions and
interpolations must be part 01 that process and all later Mss in
which they reappear must be derived from Cus. Among these, as
Ι said, are V in its first portion and Voss. 1 ; and therefore their
good readings, some of which I cited (add 11 814 ornne and V 241 credet
Voss. 1), must be conjectures or accidentS‚ and are not derived from
the parent of the family ο..

p. ix l. 13. The reading of Cus. at Ι 130 13 not sumina, which
was a false report of Postgate's, but summum, as Bechert says.

p. ix 11. 14 sq. parati at 111 395 is the reading also of L2.

p. ix l. 17. The reading of Cus. at V 585 is not forcis but fortis.

p. ix 11. 34 sqq. The Venetus is described by Gronouius obs. 111
c. 15 as ⁵ membranaceus Venetus coenobii D. Antonii,' which
monastery, as Mr Thielscher' points out 111 Rhein. Mus. 1907 p. 47,
was burnt down in 1687, library and all, so that the Ms is probably
now no more. But the collation of Gronouius was sent to Bentley
and transcribed by him into the margin of a copy of Scaliger's second
edition, now Adv. d. 2. 13 in the library of Trinity College Cambridge,
and was brought to light by Mr. Garrod in 1911 in his edition of
book 11 pp. xlvi—liv, where he printed (with a few errors, mostly
excusable) a selection from its readings The Venetus, as I show
on p. xiii of this volume, can now be recognised as a third indepen-
dent witness to the tradition 01 the family α. Sometimes it agrees
with G against L, whether in truth, as at v 92 pontibus G Ven.‚
montibus L, or in falsehood, as IV 461 quintae L, quinae G Ven. 3 much
oftener with L against G, as in truth at 11 8 profusos L Ven.‚ profusas
G, in falsehood at v 4 strumisset G, strinxisset L Ven. It is more
corrupt and worse interpolated than either : for instance at IV 580
Babyloniacas summersa profugit] babilonia casum mersa profugit L,
babilonius casus profugit G, babilonia casum mutauit Ven. ; and it
has a cowardly trick 01 omitting things hard to read 01 understand,
as IV 298 deyanae dz'oeere decanica yentes. But there are some forty
places, beside those cited in vol. Ι pp. ix sqq.‚ where it gives what is
or seems to be the true reading or an approach to the truth, while
G and L give readings further from the truth or false 3 and in some
