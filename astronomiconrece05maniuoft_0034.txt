xxviii M. MANILII

from Georges' lexicon. On p. 116, having copied much incorrect information
about the contents of 11 150-264 from Scaliger, Jacob, and Bouche-Leclercq,
he proceeds ‘ nomina Graeca, quae addidi, . . . partim apud Ptolemaeum Tetrab·
1 12, 11175-196‚ 664-670 inueniuntur (Bouche-Leclercq l'astr. Gr. p. 153).’
There are no such places in Ptol. tetr. as ‘ Π 175-196, 664-670 ’ z in Bouche-
Leclercq these are references to Manilius. At 111 221 my words ‘ quam sol
orbem suum diurnum incipiens tenuerit ’ are transcribed in such a hurry that
he 1133 written ‘ diuturnum ³. At IV 206 Palamedeis he has ‘ Firmicus Libram
fingit ab homine portatam, qui homo Palamedes, bilancis inuentor, esse
dicebatur a nonnullis (Ampel. lib. mem. 2 7) ’. Ampelius calls him not Pala-
medes but Mochos : van Wageningen has blundered in copying from Bouche-
Leclercq astr. Gr. p. 141 n. 2, and van Wageningen's blunder is copied by Mr
J. G. W. M. de Vreese Petron 39 u.d. astr. p. 132. At V 155 he says
‘ ambitio ε cupiditas alios alliciendi, aliis placendi, cf. Hor. C. 1 36 20 ι lasciuis
ederis ambitiosior ⁹. The explanation is Breiter's, the citation Huet's, and they
obviously conflict ; but he was too busy with his fingers to notice that.

Some 01 1113 1116113 116 took measures to dissemble. Sextus empirims, whose
polemical treatise is the best introduction to Greek astrology, he had never
read, and almost every word 01 that author which appears in his notes has
been taken from mine. But he had enough originality to alter my references,
and 11 Ι wrote πρὸσ ἀστρ. 70 he substituted ‘ adu. math. 70 ⁵, which he supposed
to mean the same thing. It does not even mean anything : ‘ adu. math.'‚ 11
1116 poor pilferer did but know it, is a work in six books, of which πρὸσ ἀστρ.
13 1116 fifth. But envy rather than shame is his usual motive 101· disguise, and
he will name a 13136 source to conceal the true. At 1 424 non posse timens I had
noted that non posse meant ne non posset and had remarked upon this rarer
sense, neglected by grammarians and lexicographers, of the infinitivo 31161·
timere. Thereupon he wrote ‘ non posse timens pro ne non posset, cf. Kiihner
L.G. Π2 1 667 a ², where of course there is not a word on 1116 subject. At 1 871
I said ⁶ modo, postmodo ', citing parallels, unknown to the dictionaries and
grammars, from Lucr. 11 1133—5 and other classical poets. Eight years later
Mr Loefstedt explained the word in Lucretius similarly, citing no parallel
from any classical author. This enabled van Wageningen to write ‘ modo,
postmodo, Lucr. 11 1133-1135 (Lofst. Per. 242) ’. Α1 111 257 his inapposite
references to Bouche-Leclercq and Boll are means 01 diverting attention
from the fact that his note is a reproduction of mine.

In adorning her humble home with extraneous objects the magpie is not
more helped by her freedom from scruple than she is hindered by her defects
of taste and judgment. Diamonds and broken glass are all one to her, and
she picks up and carries off what a discriminating thies would leave in the
gutter. At 11 1 Mr Garrod had made the irrelevant and unhappy remark
that Homer was held by some to be ἀστρολόγοσε 3 fact which Manilius, if it
occurred to him, took good care not to mention. Van Wageningen, having
read this note and forgotten his own text, said ‘ l—ll Homerus laudatur primus
uates et astrologus '. At 11 31 sq. the devoted daughter 01 Icarius is described
as pietate ad sidera ductam Ι Eriyonen, on which Mr Garrod wrote ‘pietatm
because ErigonezVirgo :Iustitia ’. This is a mistake which can never have
been made before, but van Wageningen hastens to make it again, ‘ Eriqonen
:Virginem :Iustitiam '. At 11 41, where motus means emotions, Mr Garrod in
his translation rendered it by ‘ notes ', but cited in his commentary Verg. georg.
1 350 and Hor. carm. 111 6 21, where it means dances. Van Wageningen mixes
