xiv M. MANILII

dislike the labour, for which they are ill qualified, of patient and
impartial examination—critics who thirty years ago would have
accepted G’s lections in the lump—now wish to believe that all these
readings are conjectures. But a great many of them are incredibly
good for the 11th century, and some of them are demonstrably
drawn from an ancient source.

That source may sometimes be β. In 1v 414, where L has
minoribus, G minor with a blank space following, and Ven. nothing,
L'2 writes ouit overhead. This, being meaningless can be no con-
jecture, and it is in fact part of the reading of M, minor ibi touit.
In 11 372, where GL have inclinat anne, L2 underlines anne and writes
uel ac above cm : this makes no sense, but is nearly identical with
the inclinata cue of M. In Ι 520, where GL have ponto, L2 writes
puncto, which is meaningless with the currat of L and is part of M's
true reading puncto curuat. The same tale is told by 1v 422 ponti
L² et corr. ex pontu M, christi GL, 11 744 uires L2M, om. GL, 1v 573
animus L2M, om. GL. It is therefore arbitrary to suppose that the
following lections of L² are not also a part of the tradition: 1 470
conditur L2M, caeditur GL, 616 uestiyia L2M, fastiyia GL, 820 torridus
L2M, cordibus GL, 863 cum L2M, ne GL, 11 728 quia L2M, que L, quae G,
756 per L2M‚ et G, t L, 1v 541 reuocet L²M‚ reticet L, retitet G, v 528
perfundit L2M, perfunto L, perfuncto G; I do not add 11 880 monte
sub aethna L2, montes subetna M, montes ceteris omissis GL, for there
the true emendation was not hard to find.

At 1v 245 the reading of L Ven., and therefore presumably of α,
is flumina: GL2 have munera. This is the reading of β or of the
archetype, corrupted in M to numera. At lv 851

luna uotum tantum deficit in orbes L
luna nouum tantum defecit in orbem Ven.,

whatever the reading of α may have been, it certainly was not

luna suo tunc tantum deficit orbe GL2 ;
but this is virtually the same as

lunas uotum tantum deficit orbe M.

At v 41 L has pectus erit puppim and Ven. had uectus . . .puppi:
by comparing the pector . . . puppi of M it can be inferred that α had
pectus . . . puppi. GL2 have rector . . . puppis. This, if a correction,
is a correction not of a’s reading but of β’5; and it is more probably
the reading of β itself or of the archetype, transmitted without
mistake.
