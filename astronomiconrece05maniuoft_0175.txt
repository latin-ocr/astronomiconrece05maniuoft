LIBRO I ADDENDA 113

in Man. IV 7 7 3-7, where it is said that Rome was founded and the
reigning emperor born under Libra. That the Moon was in Libra
at the foundation of Rome we are informed on the authority of
L. Tarutius Firmanus by Cicero de diu. 11 98, Solinus 1 18, and
Lydus de mens. 1 14 ; and that she was also in Libra at the birth of
Tiberius we know from Suet. Tib. 5 combined with the modern tables
of astronomical chronology. Further, as I have remarked in the
addenda to IV 122-291 on p 156, the effects there attributed to the
twelve signs must apparently be effects which they produce not
when occupying the horoscope but when occupied by the Moon.

My assignment of book IV to the reign of Tiberius is therefore
confirmed. The conjunction of Libra with Tiberius on the Pontio
coin should mean what the similar conjunction of Capricorn with
Augustus is now found to mean, that the man was born when the
Moon was in that sign3 and he was. The statement in IV 7 73—7
that Rome was founded and the reigning emperor born under
Libra, since it means that the Moon was in Libra when Rome was
founded, should mean that she was in Libra when the reigning
emperor was born; and so she was if the reigning emperor was
Tiberius. And that Tiberius was in fact the reigning emperor is,
as I said, the plain sense of IV 764-6. But the account in IV 547-52
of the effects of the first part of Libra when occupying the horoscope
is best referred, as I allowed in 1903 that it might be, to Augustus,
since we do not know what sign occupied the horoscope at Tiberius’
birth. It fits Augustus perfectly3 and the words ⁴ illum . . . caeli
post terras iura manebunt ' admit, though they do not require, the
interpretation that he was dead and deified.*

* I ought perhaps to say a word on certain attempts to make Scorpius the
natal star of Tiberius. In the so-called gemma Augustea at Vienna, figured in
Gardthausen's Augustus 1 p. 1231, Rome and Augustus sit side by side with
Capricorn above them, Tiberius descends from a triumphal car, and soldiers are
rearing a trophy on which hangs a shield, not Roman in shape, with the device
of a scorpion. Passow opusc. acad. pp. 321-9 and A. von Domaszewski Abh. z.
romischen Religion pp. 14 sq. connect this emblem with Tiberius and remark
that at his birth the Sun was in Scorpius. It was, and for three weeks before
and a week afterwards ; but Scorpius was not therefore his natal star, nor is
it credible that this sign should for that reason be associated with Tiberius in
a gem which associates with Augustus the sign occupied at his birth not by the
Sun but by the Moon. Moreover Tiberius and this scorpion-shield are not in
fact associated, but appear in different compartments of the design. A shield
of foreign shape on a Roman trophy would most naturally be a spoil from the
vanquished, and the scorpion (which appears again, this time on a square shield‚
in a trophy figured by Zoega Bassirilievi 11 tav. 113) is much more likely to be
somehow indicative of Illyria or Pannonia. Passow mentions another gem,
